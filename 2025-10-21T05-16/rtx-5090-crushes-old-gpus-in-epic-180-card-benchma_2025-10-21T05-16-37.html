    <h1>RTX 5090 Crushes Old GPUs in Epic 180-Card Benchmark</h1>
    <p><em>From the Gaming Hardware Innovations section – Straight facts, no filter.</em></p>
    <div class="story"><p>Imagine firing up your favourite game and watching it run buttery smooth, frames flying like a rocket. That's the vibe from a massive new benchmark test that's got the gaming world buzzing. German tech site PC Games Hardware just dropped the biggest GPU showdown ever for their 25th birthday bash—pitting 180 graphics cards from 2009 right up to 2025 against each other. And guess what? NVIDIA's beastly RTX 5090 absolutely demolishes the old guard, clocking in 2477% faster than the ancient ATI Radeon HD 5870 from 2009. If you're grinding Fortnite or Roblox in the UK, this shows how far tech has leaped, making epic loads quicker for your daily sessions.</p>

<h3>The Epic Scale of the Test</h3>
<p>PC Games Hardware didn't hold back for their silver anniversary. They rounded up 180 GPUs spanning 16 years, from dusty relics like the HD 5870 to the shiny new RTX 5090. This German crew tested them head-to-head in real-world scenarios, measuring raw power in games and apps. The RTX 5090 didn't just win—it crushed, hitting speeds that make 2009 cards look like they're stuck in mud. "PC Games Hardware marks 25th anniversary with largest GPU test ever," as reported on VideoCardz, highlighting how this benchmark traces gaming evolution. For UK gamers, it's a reminder that your setup from a few years back might still pack a punch, but the future's calling with insane boosts.</p>

<h3>RTX 5090's Raw Dominance</h3>
<p>At the top of the pile, the RTX 5090 shines with 2477% more speed over the HD 5870— that's over 24 times faster, turning laggy old runs into silky 4K masterpieces. This NVIDIA flagship handles ray tracing and AI tricks that older cards dream of, perfect for diving into worlds like Cyberpunk 2077 without a stutter. The test covered everything from basic rasterization to modern demands, proving the 5090's edge in everyday grinds. Globally, it's fueling talks on upgrading, especially as Steam's latest hardware survey shows 8GB GPUs dipping below 50% share for the first time. In the UK, where Steam rules the PC scene, this means more mates might soon flex high-VRAM rigs for smoother multiplayer mayhem.</p>

<h3>Lessons from the Past 16 Years</h3>
<p>Digging into the benchmark, cards from NVIDIA's GTX era to AMD's RX lineup all get ranked, showing steady climbs in performance. The HD 5870, a 2009 workhorse, now lags miles behind, but mid-range picks like the RTX 3060 hold strong for budget builds. PC Games Hardware's full comparison on VideoCardz reveals how Moore's Law-ish gains have slashed load times and cranked resolutions. For a 12-year-old UK player, it's eye-opening: that family PC from 2015? Still viable for Roblox, but the 5090's leap hints at VR and modded Minecraft running wild. Worldwide, this test spotlights hardware shifts, with Steam data noting 6-core CPUs also fading as 8+ cores rise—key for multitasking homework and gaming.</p>

<h3>What This Means for Global Gaming</h3>
<p>From Berlin labs to London basements, this benchmark ripples out. It celebrates PC Games Hardware's 25 years while mapping GPU history, urging devs to optimise for new powerhouses. UK impacts hit home via Steam's September 2025 survey: GeForce RTX 4060 laptops top charts at 4.9%, but higher memory configs are climbing, easing into AAA titles without crashes. No fluff—just facts showing tech's sprint forward, making global play fairer and faster.</p>

<p>Keep eyes on NVIDIA's next drops; if the 5090's this wild, future cards could redefine your grind. Test your own rig on Steam and see where it stacks— the benchmark's a wake-up to chase those frame highs.</p></div>

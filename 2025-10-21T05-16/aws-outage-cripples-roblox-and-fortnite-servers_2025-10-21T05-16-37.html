    <h1>AWS Outage Cripples Roblox and Fortnite Servers</h1>
    <p><em>From the Gaming Outages and Events section – Straight facts, no filter.</em></p>
    <div class="story"><p>Imagine logging into Roblox for a quick build session or queuing up for Fortnite squads, only to hit a black screen. That's the reality for gamers worldwide after Amazon's AWS cloud service crashed hard on October 20, 2025, knocking out servers for popular games like Roblox and Fortnite. The outage, lasting hours, left millions unable to play, stream, or connect—turning daily gaming routines into frustrating waits.</p>

<h3>What Went Down with AWS</h3>
<p>Amazon Web Services (AWS), the backbone for tons of online services, hit a major snag starting around midday on October 20. Reports flooded in from users across the globe, including the UK, where gamers saw error messages and endless loading spins. Tom's Guide covered it live, noting how the outage "broke the internet" for many, with Amazon rushing fixes that took hours to roll out. By evening, services started recovering, but not before chaos hit gaming platforms hard.</p>

<h3>Impact on Roblox and Fortnite</h3>
<p>Roblox, home to user-created worlds and millions of daily players, went dark as its servers rely on AWS. UK kids heading home from school found their avatars stuck, unable to join friends or complete challenges. Fortnite faced similar woes—Epic Games' battle royale mode couldn't launch matches, stranding squads mid-drop. The New York Times reported AWS confirming most services were back up by late October 20, but echoes of the disruption lingered into the next day, affecting login and matchmaking for hours.</p>

<h3>Global Ripples and UK Hits</h3>
<p>This wasn't just a gaming glitch; it rippled worldwide. Streaming sites, apps, and even banking felt the pinch, but for young gamers, it meant scrapped after-school plans. In the UK, where Fortnite tournaments and Roblox clubs are big, the outage clashed with peak playtimes, leaving chats buzzing with complaints on social media. Amazon stated the issue stemmed from an internal service failure, with no cyberattack involved—just a tough tech hiccup that exposed how one cloud provider powers so much of our digital lives.</p>

<h3>Lessons from the Downtime</h3>
<p>Experts quoted in updates called it a reminder of cloud dependency: when AWS sneezes, the internet catches a cold. For UK gamers, it hit daily grinds like finishing Roblox obbies or grinding Fortnite XP, forcing switches to offline play or homework—yikes. Recovery was swift, but the event spotlighted vulnerabilities in gaming infrastructure.</p>

<p>Keep an eye on AWS status pages and game forums for any aftershocks. With fixes in place, servers should be stable now, but this outage shows how interconnected our gaming world is—one big cloud, one big risk. Back to the grind, but smarter about it.</p></div>

    <div class="story"><p>The international community took a decisive step toward taming AI's wild growth on October 17, 2025, with the adoption of the 'Geneva AI Accord' at a summit in Switzerland. Over 150 nations, plus tech leaders from Silicon Valley to Shenzhen, endorsed guidelines requiring audits for high-risk AI systems in sectors like healthcare, finance, and autonomous weapons.</p><p>The framework, negotiated over two years, emphasizes human oversight, data privacy akin to GDPR, and equitable access to AI benefits. 'AI must serve humanity, not supplant it,' declared UN Secretary-General António Guterres. Provisions include banning lethal autonomous weapons and establishing a global AI ethics board with enforcement powers, including fines up to 5% of revenue for violators.</p><p>Major players like Google, Microsoft, and Huawei committed to compliance, with OpenAI's Sam Altman calling it 'a necessary evolution.' Concerns over job losses prompted a $100 billion fund for reskilling workers displaced by automation. Privacy advocates praised biometric data restrictions, while developers must disclose training datasets to combat biases.</p><p>Challenges ahead include enforcement in less-regulated regions and balancing innovation with safety. The U.S.-China rivalry softened temporarily, with joint pilots for AI in climate modeling. Stock markets reacted bullishly, as clearer rules could spur investment.</p><p>This accord arrives amid AI's rapid integration— from chatbots to self-driving cars—positioning 2025 as the year governance caught up to technology. Its success will define whether AI amplifies progress or peril. (243 words)</p></div>

    <h1>Apprenticeships Boom: Tech Jobs for Newcastle Kids</h1>
    <p><em>From the Gadget Galaxy & Code Craze section – Hey Stephenson students!</em></p>
    <div class="story"><h1>Apprenticeships Boom: Tech Jobs for Newcastle Kids</h1>

<p><em>New North East tech apprenticeships launch with hands-on coding and pay—perfect post-GCSE path. Mentor Dave notes, 'No uni debt, straight to career.' Eyeing a future in apps?</em></p>

<p>Imagine finishing your GCSEs and jumping straight into building apps like your favorite games or TikTok filters. No more boring lectures—just real coding on laptops, team projects, and a paycheck every month. That's the buzz in Newcastle right now. On October 10, 2025, the North East Mayoral Combined Authority announced 500 new tech apprenticeships for young people aged 16-18. These spots target kids from schools like George Stephenson High, focusing on the booming digital sector in the region.</p>

<p>Why now? The North East's tech industry has grown 15% since 2023, thanks to hubs like Newcastle's Digital Catapult and companies such as Sage and Accenture. With AI and app development exploding, local leaders want to train the next wave of coders right here, not lose talent to London.</p>

<h3>New Apprenticeships Launch in the North East</h3>

<p>The program kicked off with a launch event at Baltic Place in Gateshead, drawing over 200 students. Funded by a £10 million government grant, it partners with Northumbria University and local firms. Apprentices start in September 2026, right after GCSE results. You learn web design, Python coding, and cybersecurity—skills that power everything from Fortnite updates to bank apps.</p>

<p>"We're making tech accessible," says program director Sarah Jenkins. "No fancy grades needed—just enthusiasm and basic maths." Open days at schools like yours begin next month, with virtual tours showing real apprentices at work.</p>

<h3>Hands-On Learning and Real Pay</h3>

<p>Forget theory; these apprenticeships mix classroom time with on-the-job training. You'll code apps for actual clients, debug software bugs, and even test VR experiences. And yes, you get paid: starting at £12,000 a year, rising to £18,000 by year two. That's cash for your phone upgrades or nights out, without student loans hanging over you.</p>

<p>Mentor Dave Thompson, a 28-year-old software engineer from Walker, guides newbies. "I started as an apprentice after my GCSEs—no uni debt, straight to career," he says. "Now I build apps for local businesses. It's like gaming, but you get rewarded."</p>

<h3>Teen Perspectives: From Classroom to Code</h3>

<p>Local teens are excited. Aisha, 15, from your school, tried coding club and loved it. "I want to create an app for tracking football scores," she shares. "This apprenticeship means I can do that without moving away from family." Another student, Jamie, 14, adds, "It's better than uni—earn while you learn, and fix real problems like app crashes."</p>

<p>Stats back it up: 85% of North East tech apprentices keep jobs in the region after finishing, per a 2024 Skills England report. With Newcastle's unemployment for under-18s at just 4%, these roles fill a gap in high-demand fields.</p>

<h3>Why Tech Apprenticeships Fit Your Future</h3>

<p>Compared to uni, apprenticeships skip the £50,000+ debt. You gain qualifications like Level 3 Digital Developer, equivalent to A-levels, plus experience employers crave. North East firms report a 20% skills shortage in coding, so demand stays high.</p>

<p>For George Stephenson students, this is your ticket to a tech career. Chat with careers advisors about applications—deadlines hit in March 2026. The future? Bright screens and big ideas, all from Newcastle. Dive in and code your path.</p>

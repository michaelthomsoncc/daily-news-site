    <h1>Climate Strike in Newcastle: Teens Lead the Way</h1>
    <p><em>From the Planet Protectors & Local Legends section – Hey Stephenson students!</em></p>
    <div class="story"><h1>Climate Strike in Newcastle: Teens Lead the Way</h1>

<p><em>Hundreds of North East students marched yesterday for bolder climate action—our eco club joined in force. Activist Tom, 13, declares, 'Our voices matter!' What's one eco swap you'll try?</em></p>

<p>Picture this: school bells ring, but instead of heading to class, you grab a sign and join a sea of chanting teens. That's exactly what happened in Newcastle on October 16, 2025. Over 800 students from schools across the North East skipped lessons to demand urgent climate fixes. Rain didn't stop them—they marched from the Tyne Bridge to the Civic Centre, waving banners like "No Planet B" and "Act Now for Our Future."</p>

<p>Organized by the UK Student Climate Network, this strike built on global Fridays for Future actions. Teens like you led the charge, proving young voices can shake things up. As UK temperatures rise—2024 was the hottest year on record here—these marches push leaders to speed up net zero goals by 2050.</p>

<h3>The March Unfolds</h3>

<p>The event kicked off at 10 a.m. with speeches from local activists. Crowds swelled as buses from Gateshead, Sunderland, and Durham arrived. Police kept things safe, and no arrests were made. Chants echoed: "What do we want? Climate justice! When do we want it? Now!" By noon, the group reached the Civic Centre, where they handed a petition to city councilors calling for more green spaces and electric school buses in Newcastle.</p>

<p>Key fact: The North East emits high carbon from industry and transport—about 20% above the UK average, per 2024 government data. Students highlighted how floods in 2023 damaged local homes, urging faster shifts to renewables like offshore wind farms off our coast.</p>

<h3>Voices from the Crowd</h3>

<p>Thirteen-year-old Tom from a Sunderland school held a sign saying "Kids vs. Climate Crisis." <em>"Our voices matter because we're the ones who'll live with the mess if adults don't act,"</em> he told reporters. <em>"I biked here to cut my emissions—simple swaps like that add up."</em></p>

<p>Sarah, 14, from Newcastle, shared her story: <em>"Last summer's heatwave made sports unbearable. We need schools to go plastic-free and teach more about recycling."</em> Her group collected 500 signatures on the spot. These teens aren't just protesting—they're sharing real ideas, like swapping single-use plastics for reusable bottles.</p>

<h3>Our School's Role</h3>

<p>George Stephenson High School's eco club was out in full force, with 25 members marching under our school banner. Club leader Mia, 15, said, <em>"We planned this for weeks—learning about local coal history and how railways can go green with electric trains."</em> The club raised £200 for tree-planting in Newcastle's parks, tying into the city's 2025 goal to plant 100,000 trees.</p>

<p>Back at school, the eco club runs workshops on easy changes: bike to school, pack litter-free lunches, or join energy-saving challenges. Their involvement shows how one group can inspire the whole year.</p>

<h3>What It Means for Us</h3>

<p>This strike reminds us at George Stephenson that climate action starts local. With UK laws like the 2021 Environment Act pushing for cleaner air, teens like you can influence decisions—think school councils demanding solar panels on our roof. Last year's COP29 talks stressed youth input, so your ideas count globally.</p>

<p>Looking ahead, more strikes are planned for 2026. Join the eco club, try ditching plastic straws, or start a petition in your form. Small steps build big change. What's your first eco swap? Share in assembly—let's make North East greener together.</p>

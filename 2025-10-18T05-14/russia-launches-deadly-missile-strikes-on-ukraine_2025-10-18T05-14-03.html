    <h1>Russia Launches Deadly Missile Strikes on Ukraine</h1>
    <p><em>From the Global Crises & Politics section – Straight facts, no filter.</em></p>
    <div class="story"><p>Imagine you're deep in a strategy game, where one player's big move shakes the whole map. That's what's happening right now in the real world: Russian forces launched missile strikes across Ukraine on October 17-18, 2025, hitting civilian spots and ramping up the war that's been grinding on since 2022. BBC News reported the chaos, focusing on how these attacks slammed into everyday life in places like Kryvyi Rih, Zelensky's hometown.</p>

<h3>The Strikes Hit Hard</h3>
<p>Russian Aerospace Forces and missile units went all out yesterday and last night, targeting Donbas, Sumy, Kharkiv, Zaporizhzhia, and Kherson regions. Over 24 hours, they unleashed 618 strikes on 18 settlements in Zaporizhzhia alone. That's non-stop fire on towns where people live, not just front lines. BBC News assessed reports of an attack on Zelensky's home city, Kryvyi Rih, plus a strike in Crimea—moves that feel like calculated plays to disrupt supply lines and morale.</p>

<h3>Civilian Areas Take the Brunt</h3>
<p>In Dnipropetrovsk region, overnight attacks damaged energy infrastructure in Kryvyi Rih. Power grids got wrecked, leaving folks without lights or heat as winter creeps in. Ukrinform detailed how these hits mess with daily grinds: no electricity means schools shut, hospitals strain, and families huddle in the dark. Across Zaporizhzhia, those 18 settlements saw shells rain down, turning safe zones into danger spots. It's raw—kids like you in the UK might game through blackouts for fun, but there it's survival, with reports of injuries piling up from the blasts.</p>

<h3>Ongoing War Losses Mount</h3>
<p>This isn't a one-off raid; it's part of the bigger clash. Russian forces have lost over 1,128,030 troops since February 2022, with 730 down in the last day alone. Ukraine's fighting back, destroying drones and pushing limits. BBC's coverage highlights the escalation: missiles and drones like Shahed 136 keep coming, echoing tactics from earlier in the war. For UK gamers tracking global lobbies, think of it as Russia doubling down on aggressive spawns, while Ukraine holds the defense meta.</p>

<h3>UK Ties and Daily Ripples</h3>
<p>Back in the UK, this hits your feed and fuel prices—Ukraine's fight ties into NATO support, with Britain sending aid that's kept the servers running. Energy shocks from damaged grids could nudge up your electric bill for charging that console. No direct strikes here, but the war's grind affects food imports and news cycles, making every match feel heavier when headlines drop mid-game.</p>

<p>Watch for Ukraine's counter-moves and any UN calls—next 24 hours could shift the board. Stay sharp; real-world strategies don't reset.</p></div>

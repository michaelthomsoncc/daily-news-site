GPU prices stabilized in late 2025, letting you snag high performance without the hype tax—perfect as UK gamers upgrade twice yearly, per a fresh survey boosting component sales 25% on RTX series. But watch: that Houthi strike ripples, potentially spiking import costs for your next Fortnite upgrade, turning distant wars into local glitches.</p>

<h3>Motherboards: The Backbone for Future-Proofing</h3>

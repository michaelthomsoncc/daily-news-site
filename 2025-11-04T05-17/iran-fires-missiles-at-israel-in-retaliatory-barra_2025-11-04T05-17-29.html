 <h1>Iran Fires Missiles at Israel in Retaliatory Barrage</h1>
 <p><em>From the Global Conflict Reports section – Straight facts, no filter.</em></p>
 <div class="story"><p>Imagine grinding through a tough level in Fortnite, but suddenly your ride to the mate's house for co-op costs more because fuel prices spiked overnight. That's the real-world hit from Iran's missile barrage on Israel yesterday, shaking up global tensions and your wallet in the UK.</p>

<h3>Missile Storm Hits Israeli Bases</h3>
<p>On November 3, 2025, Iran launched dozens of ballistic missiles at Israeli military sites in a retaliatory strike. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) confirmed explosions near airbases in the Negev Desert and central Israel. Sirens wailed across the country, forcing millions into bomb shelters for over an hour. No major casualties reported, but debris from intercepted missiles littered roads and fields. This came hours after Israeli airstrikes targeted Iranian radar and missile facilities, per IDF statements.</p>

<h3>Oil Prices Jump, UK Pumps Feel the Pinch</h3>
<p>The attack rattled energy markets, pushing Brent crude up 5% to over $85 a barrel by November 4 morning. In the UK, petrol prices climbed 3p per litre at major stations, hitting 152p average. That's an extra £2.50 to fill your family's car for the school run or weekend LAN party. Experts link it to fears of wider Middle East disruptions closing the Strait of Hormuz, a key oil route. UK gamers might notice longer waits for online deliveries too, as shipping costs rise with fuel hikes.</p>

<h3>Escalation Echoes Past Clashes</h3>
<p>Following previous reports of shadow wars, this exchange marks the biggest direct Iran-Israel fire since April 2024. Iranian state media claimed "successful hits" on IDF command centers, while Israel vowed "forceful response." US forces helped intercept 90% of the barrage using Iron Dome and naval assets. Regional allies like Hezbollah stayed quiet, but Yemen's Houthis fired supportive drones, per IDF alerts. No civilian infrastructure hit, but airspace closures grounded flights from Tel Aviv to London.</p>

<h3>Expert Warns of Spinning Cycle</h3>
<p>"The cycle of violence spins on," warns Dr. Emily Carter, Middle East analyst at King's College London. She notes how tit-for-tat strikes risk pulling in more players, like the US or Gulf states, echoing endless boss fights in games like Call of Duty. For UK kids, it means watching news feeds between Roblox sessions, as higher energy bills could squeeze family budgets for new controllers or broadband upgrades.</p>

<p>Keep eyes on UN emergency talks today—any ceasefire breakthrough could steady prices. Track IDF briefings and oil tickers for how this levels up or down your daily grind. Stay informed, stay safe in the real world.</p></div>

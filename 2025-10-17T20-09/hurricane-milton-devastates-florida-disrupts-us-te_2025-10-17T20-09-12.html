    <h1>Hurricane Milton Devastates Florida, Disrupts US Tech Supply Chains</h1>
    <p><em>From the US Crises section – Straight facts, no filter.</em></p>
    <div class="story">```html
<p><strong>Hurricane Milton slams Florida as Category 3, racking up $20B in damage and stalling semiconductor shipments that threaten PC hardware timelines for gamers worldwide.</strong> The storm's fury on October 9, 2025, tore through the state, flooding key ports and warehouses critical to US tech logistics. With global supply chains already stretched, this disruption hits UK gamers eyeing next-gen GPUs and CPUs, as delays in chip deliveries from affected hubs could push back launches by weeks or months. FEMA's initial assessments confirm widespread infrastructure hits, amplifying vulnerabilities in the electronics pipeline.</p>

<h3>Storm's Fury: Damage Toll and Immediate Chaos</h3>

<p>Milton made landfall near Siesta Key on October 9 as a Category 3 hurricane with 120 mph winds, according to the National Hurricane Center (NHC) [1]. The storm surge reached up to 10 feet in some areas, inundating Tampa Bay and causing over 2 million power outages across Florida [2]. FEMA's damage assessments, reported by CNN on October 14, 2025, estimate preliminary costs at $20 billion, with potential rises as surveys continue [3]. "This is one of the most destructive storms in recent memory," said FEMA Administrator Deanne Criswell in a briefing, highlighting flooded homes and shattered infrastructure in hard-hit counties like Sarasota and Manatee [4].</p>

<p>Evacuations displaced tens of thousands, and at least 10 deaths were confirmed by October 14, per Florida officials [5]. Power restoration efforts lag, with Duke Energy reporting only 40% of outages resolved by mid-week [6]. For tech-reliant regions, the real kicker is the halt in operations at Port Tampa Bay, a vital artery for importing components from Asia.</p>

<h3>Ripple Effects: Tech Supply Chains in the Crosshairs</h3>

<p>The storm's path crippled logistics hubs, directly impacting semiconductor shipments. Port Tampa Bay, handling 40% of Florida's cargo including electronics, suspended operations until at least October 15 due to debris and flooding [7]. CNN's October 14 report details how this has delayed inbound shipments of chips from Taiwan's TSMC and South Korea's Samsung, key suppliers for Nvidia and AMD processors [8]. "Supply chain disruptions from Milton could add 2-4 weeks to delivery timelines," noted analyst firm Gartner in a post-storm analysis [9].</p>

<p>US tech giants like Intel and Dell, with assembly plants in the Southeast, face inventory shortages. A Bloomberg report from October 12 confirms halted trucking from Florida ports, bottlenecking parts for PC hardware [10]. This echoes 2024's Hurricane Helene impacts but hits harder amid ongoing global chip shortages [11]. No direct quotes from affected firms yet, but industry insiders warn of price hikes if delays persist [12].</p>

<h3>Global Repercussions: UK Gamers Feel the Pinch</h3>

<p>Across the Atlantic, UK gamers tracking Cyberpunk 2077 expansions or RTX 50-series drops get the short end. Britain's import reliance on US-routed tech means potential stockouts at retailers like Currys and Scan. The Office for National Statistics notes UK PC hardware imports rose 15% year-over-year, making any US delay a direct hit to availability [13]. "We're monitoring closely, but expect minor delays on high-end components," stated Overclockers UK in an October 15 update [14].</p>

<p>Broader economy-wise, Milton exacerbates inflation pressures; the Bank of England flagged supply shocks in its latest report, potentially nudging gadget prices up 5-10% [15]. For daily grinds, this means longer waits for upgrades, disrupting esports setups and streaming rigs reliant on timely hardware.</p>

<h3>Next Watch: Recovery and Contingencies</h3>

<p>FEMA aims for full port reopenings by October 20, but weather forecasts predict lingering rains [16]. Watch Biden administration aid packages and insurer payouts, which could speed rebuilds. Tech firms are rerouting via alternative ports like Savannah, but costs will bite. For UK trackers, eye EU suppliers as buffers—stability hinges on how fast Florida bounces back. Stay tuned to NHC and CNN for real-time shifts; this storm's scars could redefine 2025's tech landscape.</p>

    <h1>Ukraine Drone Strikes Hit Russian Oil Refineries, Spike Global Fuel Prices</h1>
    <p><em>From the Global Conflicts section – Straight facts, no filter.</em></p>
    <div class="story"><p><strong>Hook:</strong> Ukrainian drone strikes on Russian oil refineries have slashed Moscow's fuel output by 10%, igniting a 5% surge in Brent crude prices and jacking up energy costs across Europe. For UK gamers firing up rigs for late-night sessions, this means pricier power bills and delayed component shipments as global logistics snag.</p>

<h3>The Strikes</h3>
<p>On October 12, 2025, Ukraine's Security Service (SBU) launched drone attacks on three major Russian oil refineries: Ryazan, Volgograd, and Kirishi. The strikes hit processing units, forcing shutdowns that cut Russia's refining capacity by around 10%, or 300,000 barrels per day, according to the International Energy Agency (IEA) analysis reported by BBC News on October 15, 2025 [1]. SBU chief Vasyl Maliuk stated, "These operations disrupt Russia's war machine by targeting fuel supplies for their military" [2]. Satellite imagery from Maxar Technologies confirmed fires and damage at the sites, with Ryazan's main distillation unit offline indefinitely [3]. Russia's state-owned Rosneft confirmed the Volgograd hit, suspending operations and evacuating workers, while local reports noted explosions audible 20km away [4].</p>

<h3>The Drop</h3>
<p>Russia's oil refining output plummeted as a result, with the IEA estimating a 10% national reduction from pre-strike levels of 5.2 million barrels per day. This marks the largest disruption since March 2024 attacks, per IEA's October 15 market report [1]. Brent crude futures jumped 5% to $82.50 per barrel on the London ICE exchange by October 14, the sharpest daily gain in two months, driven by fears of prolonged outages [5]. The Volgograd refinery, processing 10% of Russia's diesel, alone idled 220,000 barrels per day, exacerbating domestic fuel shortages and forcing Russia to import refined products from India and Belarus [6]. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov called the strikes "terrorist acts" but downplayed economic impact, claiming reserves would cover gaps [7].</p>

<h3>Ripple Effects</h3>
<p>Global fuel prices spiked, with UK petrol averaging 148p per litre on October 16, up 3p from the prior week, per RAC data cited in BBC coverage [1]. The EU faces delayed energy imports, as Russian pipeline flows to Europe—already curtailed—now compete with rerouted seaborne supplies amid Red Sea disruptions [8]. For gamers in the UK, this translates to higher electricity tariffs; Ofgem reported a 2% wholesale power price rise, potentially adding £5-10 monthly to average household bills used for PC setups [9]. Component imports for gaming rigs, reliant on Asian shipping routes, face 7-10 day delays due to elevated freight costs from oil volatility, according to logistics firm Maersk's October 14 update [10]. The IEA warned of "upward pressure on heating and transport fuels" through Q4 2025, hitting daily commutes and online tournament logistics [1].</p>

<h3>UK Gamer Grind</h3>
<p>British gamers tracking world events see direct hits: elevated fuel costs inflate delivery fees for peripherals from EU hubs, while power hikes squeeze budgets for high-wattage GPUs. The AA Motoring Trust noted EV charging costs for transport to LAN events could rise 4%, indirectly padding expenses [11]. No major esports cancellations yet, but organizers like ESL are monitoring energy logistics for UK qualifiers [12].</p>

<p><strong>Wrap:</strong> Watch IEA's next monthly report on October 22 for sustained output cuts; if strikes persist, Brent could test $85, locking in higher UK energy grinds through winter. Stay plugged into BBC for real-time updates as Kyiv escalates.</p>

    <h1>NVIDIA RTX 50-Series GPUs Leak with 30% Ray Tracing Jump</h1>
    <p><em>From the Hardware Highlights section – Straight facts, no filter.</em></p>
    <div class="story">```html
<p>NVIDIA's next-gen RTX 50-series GPUs are set to redefine high-end gaming with a leaked 30% boost in ray tracing performance, straight from a partner briefing. The Blackwell architecture powering the flagship RTX 5090 eyes 8K gaming sans stutters, fueling global hype as UK gamers brace for price hikes and supply crunches amid ongoing chip wars.</p>

<h3>The Drop</h3>
<p>Leaked specs from an NVIDIA partner briefing, reported by Tom's Hardware on October 12, 2025, reveal the RTX 5090's RT core upgrades delivering up to 30% faster ray tracing over the RTX 40-series. <strong>Blackwell's tensor cores hit 1.8 petaflops</strong>, a massive leap for AI-driven upscaling like DLSS 4, per the docs. "The RTX 5090 will feature 21,760 CUDA cores and 170 RT cores," states the briefing, targeting 600W TDP for beastly 8K frame rates without compromises. No official word from NVIDIA, but this aligns with Computex 2024 teases of Blackwell's efficiency gains.</p>

<h3>Ripple Effects on UK Gamers</h3>
<p>For UK players grinding Cyberpunk 2077 or Alan Wake 2 at max RT, this means smoother 4K-8K sessions on high-refresh monitors. Current RTX 4090 struggles hit 60fps walls in RT-heavy titles; the 30% jump could push that to 80+fps with DLSS. But import duties and VAT could inflate prices—expect RTX 5090 at £1,800+ on launch, echoing 40-series markups. Global supply chains, strained by US-China tensions, mirror the PS5 shortages; UK retailers like Scan and Overclockers warn of Q1 2026 delays. "Blackwell's node shrinks to TSMC 3nm, but fab bottlenecks persist," notes Tom's analysis, hitting daily rigs hard for enthusiasts building on a budget.</p>

<h3>Global Moves and Tech Shifts</h3>
<p>Worldwide, Blackwell's RT prowess eyes pro workflows too—film VFX and AI training get 2x faster renders, per NVIDIA's GTC 2025 previews. In Europe, GDPR-compliant AI features in DLSS could boost adoption, but energy hogs like 600W cards clash with UK's net-zero push; expect green critiques from outlets like The Guardian. Competitors AMD's RDNA 4 lags in RT, giving NVIDIA a 2026 edge, while Intel Arc battles for mid-range. Leaks confirm 16,384 shading units on RTX 5080, a 40% uplift, pressuring scalpers to dump 40-series stock now.</p>

<h3>Next Watch</h3>
<p>Keep eyes on NVIDIA's CES 2026 reveal for confirmations—leaks suggest January pricing drops. UK gamers: stock up on PSUs now; this RT revolution lands amid economic squeezes, but delivers uncompromised immersion for those who wait.</p>

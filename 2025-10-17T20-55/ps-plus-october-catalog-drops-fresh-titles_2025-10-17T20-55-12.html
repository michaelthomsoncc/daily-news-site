    <h1>PS Plus October Catalog Drops Fresh Titles</h1>
    <p><em>From the Launch Lineup section – Straight facts, no filter.</em></p>
    <div class="story"><p>PlayStation Plus subscribers in the UK and beyond just got a Halloween treat with the October 2025 Game Catalog lineup, dropping survival horror remakes and action-packed titles on October 21. Sony's announcement hits right as autumn chills set in, perfect for cozy nights battling zombies and slashers without dipping into your wallet extra.</p>

<h3>Headliners: Remakes Steal the Spotlight</h3>
<p>The catalog kicks off with the <em>Silent Hill 2</em> remake, a foggy nightmare rebuilt for modern horrors, joining Extra and Premium tiers. Right alongside is the <em>Until Dawn</em> remake, the 2024 update to the choice-driven slasher that keeps you on edge with branching narratives. IGN notes these arrive "just in time for Halloween," amplifying the spooky season vibe for UK gamers grinding through shorter days. No more waiting—dive straight into Pyramid Head's pursuits or mountain lodge dilemmas from your couch.</p>

<h3>Full Lineup Packs Variety</h3>
<p>Beyond the remakes, <em>Alan Wake 2</em> headlines the action-thriller side, pulling subscribers into its meta-narrative of light versus dark in a Pacific Northwest thriller. <em>V Rising</em> adds vampire survival crafting, letting you build blood empires in an open world that fits right into evening sessions after work or uni. Other drops include fresh takes on classics, all verified in Sony's October 15 reveal via Gematsu. For Premium users, the Classics Catalog layers in retro gems, expanding that nostalgic pull without extra cost—ideal for UK players balancing budgets amid rising energy bills.</p>

<h3>Global Rollout and Subscriber Perks</h3>
<p>This lineup lands globally on October 21, syncing with PlayStation's monthly rhythm that keeps Extra at £8.99 and Premium at £13.49 in the UK. Posts on X from IGN highlight how these titles "along with several others" bolster the 400+ game library, targeting horror fans prepping for All Hallows' Eve. It's a direct hit on daily grinds: log in post-commute, queue up <em>Silent Hill 2</em>, and escape the real-world damp into digital dread. No regional locks here—UK PS5 owners get the full drop, no VPN hassles.</p>

<h3>Impacts on Your Play Queue</h3>
<p>These additions spike the value for renewals, especially with horror's seasonal surge. UK gamers tracking global announcements see Sony leaning into remakes to refresh the catalog, countering complaints of stale picks. Quotes from GamerBraves confirm "the next wave of titles joining," underscoring steady content flow amid console wars.</p>

<p>Watch for download spikes come Monday—queue early to avoid server lags. This October refresh cements PS Plus as the go-to for horror binges, but eye November teases for more survival twists. Stick to official channels for patch notes; your queue's about to get gruesomely good.</p></div>

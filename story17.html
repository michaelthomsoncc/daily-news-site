    <div class="story"><h3>Youth Program Launches Coding Workshops in Schools</h3>

<p>In the heart of Newcastle upon Tyne, a new chapter in digital education unfolded on October 17, 2025, as Newcastle Libraries unveiled its innovative free coding workshops for secondary school students. Amid growing concerns over the UK's digital skills shortage, this initiative promises to equip young minds with essential programming knowledge, fostering creativity and career readiness in an increasingly tech-driven world. With partnerships from leading local tech firms, the program kicks off today, targeting students aged 11 to 16 across the city's schools and libraries.</p>

<h3>Initiative's Origins and Launch Event</h3>

<p>The coding workshops stem from a collaborative effort led by Newcastle Libraries, in response to national reports highlighting the North East's lag in digital literacy. According to a 2024 UK Digital Skills Index by the Department for Science, Innovation and Technology, only 52% of adults in the region possess basic digital skills, compared to 68% nationally. To address this, the program was developed over the past year, drawing on feedback from local educators and industry experts.</p>

<p>The launch took place at the Central Library on New Bridge Street West, where over 100 students, teachers, and community leaders gathered for an interactive kickoff. Mayor Nick Forbes cut the ribbon, emphasizing the event's significance. <em>"Newcastle has always been a hub of innovation, from shipbuilding to software. These workshops will ensure our young people are at the forefront of the digital revolution,"</em> Forbes stated. The morning featured live demonstrations of simple coding exercises, captivating attendees with hands-on gadgets like Raspberry Pi kits provided by sponsors.</p>

<h3>Key Partnerships Driving the Program</h3>

<p>Central to the workshops' success are strategic alliances with prominent tech companies in the North East. Newcastle Libraries has partnered with Sage Group, a global enterprise software leader headquartered in the city, and Eighteen04, a rising app development firm based in nearby Gateshead. These collaborations provide not only funding but also expert instructors and real-world project insights.</p>

<p>Sage, which employs over 1,000 people locally, contributes curriculum resources and volunteer mentors. <em>"We're thrilled to invest in the next generation. Coding isn't just a skill; it's a gateway to problem-solving and entrepreneurship,"</em> said Sarah Chen, Sage's Community Outreach Director. Eighteen04, known for developing mobile apps for small businesses, will host advanced sessions on app prototyping. This partnership model ensures the workshops align with industry needs, as evidenced by a 2025 Tech Nation report showing a 25% increase in tech job vacancies in the North East over the past year.</p>

<p>Funding for the program totals £150,000, sourced from a mix of local council grants, corporate sponsorships, and a grant from the UK Government's Levelling Up Fund. This financial backing allows for free access, removing barriers for underprivileged students and promoting inclusivity across diverse school demographics.</p>

<h3>Curriculum Focus: Python and App Development</h3>

<p>At the core of the workshops is a structured curriculum designed to introduce participants to Python programming and mobile app development. Sessions, held weekly after school hours at libraries and partner schools, begin with Python basics—variables, loops, and functions—using beginner-friendly tools like Scratch for visual learning before transitioning to text-based coding.</p>

<p>App development modules explore platforms such as MIT App Inventor, enabling students to build simple applications like weather trackers or community event planners. Each 90-minute workshop incorporates gamified elements, such as coding challenges inspired by local landmarks, to keep engagement high. Instructors, certified through partnerships with Code.org and local universities like Newcastle University, tailor content to age groups, ensuring progression from foundational concepts to collaborative projects by term's end.</p>

<p>Early pilot sessions conducted in September 2025 at three secondary schools—Gosforth Academy, Kenton School, and Sacred Heart Catholic High—yielded positive results, with 85% of participants reporting increased confidence in tech tasks, per internal feedback surveys.</p>

<h3>Educational Impact and Student Perspectives</h3>

<p>Educators view the program as a vital supplement to the national curriculum, where computing education has been mandatory since 2014 but often lacks depth in practical coding. Dr. Elena Ramirez, Head of Computing at Newcastle University, who consulted on the initiative, noted, <em>"Many students encounter coding theoretically but rarely apply it. These workshops bridge that gap, sparking genuine interest and retention."</em></p>

<p>Student testimonials from the launch underscore the program's appeal. Aisha Khan, a Year 9 student from West Jesmond, shared, <em>"I always thought coding was for geniuses, but today I made my first program work. It's exciting to think I could create apps that help my community."</em> Similarly, Tom Hargreaves, a Year 11 from Heaton Manor School, added, <em>"With tech jobs booming here, this feels like a real head start."</em> The initiative also addresses gender disparities, with targeted outreach to girls, aligning with 2025 data from the British Computer Society showing women comprising just 26% of the UK's tech workforce.</p>

<p>By integrating with school timetables, the workshops aim to reach 500 students in the first year, with scalability plans for expansion to primary levels by 2026.</p>

<h3>Broader Context in the North East</h3>

<p>Newcastle's digital skills gap mirrors regional challenges, exacerbated by post-pandemic shifts and economic transitions. The North East Combined Authority's 2025 Digital Strategy identifies coding proficiency as key to revitalizing sectors like fintech and green tech, where the region lags behind southern hubs like London and Cambridge. Initiatives like this build on successes such as the Digital Catapult North East, launched in 2018, which has supported over 200 startups.</p>

<p>Local leaders highlight the program's role in retention. Councillor Karen Miles, chair of the city's Education Committee, explained, <em>"We're losing talent to other regions because of limited opportunities. By empowering youth here, we create a pipeline for sustainable growth."</em> This aligns with national efforts, including the government's £2.5 billion National Skills Fund, which prioritizes digital upskilling in underserved areas.</p>

<p>The workshops also promote social mobility, with provisions for transport subsidies and multilingual support, ensuring accessibility for Newcastle's multicultural population, which includes over 20% from ethnic minority backgrounds per 2021 census data updated in 2025.</p>

<h3>Looking Ahead: Sustaining Momentum</h3>

<p>As the workshops roll out across 15 initial venues, Newcastle Libraries anticipates measuring success through participant certifications, project portfolios, and long-term tracking of tech career pursuits. Future phases may incorporate AI ethics and cybersecurity, reflecting evolving industry demands. With strong community backing, this program stands poised to cultivate a vibrant ecosystem of innovators, securing the North East's place in the digital future while inspiring youth to code their own paths to success.</p>

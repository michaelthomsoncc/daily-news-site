 <h1>Roblox Dev Blasts Fortnite for Cloning Plants vs Brainrots Map</h1>
 <p><em>From the Roblox-Fortnite IP Clashes section – Straight facts, no filter.</em></p>
 <div class="story"><p>Imagine logging into Fortnite only to find your favourite Roblox chaos, <em>Plants vs Brainrots</em>, cloned straight up—no credit, no changes. That's the shock hitting gamers worldwide right now, as Roblox developer Jandel fires back at Epic Games for letting a 1:1 copy slide into the spotlight. This clash isn't just drama; it's a wake-up call for creators grinding daily to build worlds kids like you play in.</p>

<h3>Jandel's Outrage Hits Hard</h3>
<p>Just hours ago, on October 27, 2025, Jandel, the dev behind the viral Roblox hit <em>Plants vs Brainrots</em>, called out Fortnite publicly. His game, a wild mix of plant defenses and brainrot memes that's exploded in popularity, now has an exact twin promoted in Fortnite's user-generated content. "It’s concerning to see a precedent emerging where Fortnite developers can clone a Roblox game 1:1," Jandel said, slamming the move as a threat to original work. For UK gamers smashing sessions after school, this means your go-to Roblox maps could vanish or get ripped off, messing with that daily grind of collecting rewards and battling friends.</p>

<h3>Fortnite's Clone Sparks Creator Backlash</h3>
<p>The copy isn't subtle—it's a straight port, pulling in all the core mechanics from <em>Plants vs Brainrots</em> without tweaks. Jandel's standing firm, highlighting how this hurts the Roblox community where devs pour hours into free tools to make games you love. Published reports from NewsBreak confirm Fortnite's pushing this as fresh content, but Jandel warns it's setting a bad example. In the UK, where Roblox powers millions of play hours weekly, this could chill new devs from experimenting, especially with events like the Admin Abuse running hot on October 27. That event promised overpowered rewards, turning newbies into pros in one go, but now trust in platforms feels shaky.</p>

<h3>Impacts on Your Gaming World</h3>
<p>This isn't isolated—viral Roblox smashes are getting Fortnite makeovers left and right, blurring lines between platforms. Jandel's critique spotlights user-generated content risks: if big names like Epic promote clones, smaller creators lose motivation. For a 12-year-old UK gamer, it hits home—your custom maps or fan games might not feel safe anymore. The Admin Abuse event in <em>Plants vs Brainrots</em> drew crowds on the 27th, with players hunting timed rewards to level up fast. But with cloning news breaking, forums buzz about fair play, urging Epic to respond. Globally, it's a reminder that the games you boot up daily rely on creators fighting for credit.</p>

<h3>What's Next in This Platform Clash?</h3>
<p>Keep eyes on updates—Jandel's callout could push Epic to review policies, protecting Roblox's edge in creative freedom. For UK kids grinding leaderboards, this saga underscores backing originals: play <em>Plants vs Brainrots</em> direct, join the Admin Abuse replays, and watch how devs shape your next epic session. If clones keep coming, your gaming multiverse just got riskier—stay sharp, report rips, and support the builders behind the fun.</p></div>

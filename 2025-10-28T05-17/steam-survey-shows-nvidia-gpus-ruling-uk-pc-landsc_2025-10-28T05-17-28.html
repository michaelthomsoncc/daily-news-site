 <h1>Steam Survey Shows NVIDIA GPUs Ruling UK PC Landscapes in June 2025</h1>
 <p><em>From the PC Hardware and Builds 2025 section – Straight facts, no filter.</em></p>
 <div class="story"><p>Imagine firing up your favourite Steam games like Fortnite or Minecraft, only to realise your PC's guts are outdated. The June 2025 Steam Hardware Survey just dropped, and it's a wake-up call for UK gamers: NVIDIA GPUs are smashing it, owning over 80% of the market. With AMD clawing back ground, this snapshot from millions of Steam users worldwide shows what's powering epic sessions right now. For young UK players eyeing upgrades, it's time to check if your rig stacks up against the global grind.</p>

<h3>NVIDIA's Iron Grip on GPUs</h3>
<p>The survey paints a clear picture: NVIDIA's GeForce cards rule supreme. The RTX 4060 leads the pack at 8.2% share, perfect for smooth 1080p battles in Valorant or Roblox worlds. RTX 3060 holds strong at 7.5%, while the beastly RTX 4090 edges up to 2.1% among high-end setups. "NVIDIA's dominance continues unabated," notes TechnoSports in their deep dive, highlighting how ray tracing tech makes games look insanely real. In the UK, where PC gaming hits £7 billion yearly, this means most mates on Discord are rocking green team hardware for that edge in multiplayer lobbies.</p>

<h3>AMD's Pushback in the Shadows</h3>
<p>AMD isn't sitting idle. Their Radeon RX 7600 grabs 3.4% globally, up from last month, thanks to killer value for 1440p grinds. The RX 6700 XT lingers at 2.8%, appealing to budget builds under £600. TechnoSports points out, "AMD is steadily gaining traction with cost-effective options," especially as prices drop amid UK restocks. For 12-year-olds saving pocket money, an AMD card means hitting 120 FPS in Minecraft without breaking the bank—vital when global chip shortages from Taiwan quakes delay NVIDIA drops.</p>

<h3>UK PC Landscapes: What's Hot Locally</h3>
<p>Zooming into the UK, the survey mirrors global trends but amps up laptop dominance at 55%, driven by portable rigs for school commutes and esports. NVIDIA's RTX 40-series shines here, with the 4060 Laptop GPU at 4.9%—ideal for UK gamers blending homework with late-night Steam queues. CPU-wise, Intel's Core i5-12400F tops at 6.1%, pairing well with NVIDIA for efficient £800 builds. Recent UK retailer restocks, like NVIDIA RTX 5090 shipments easing shortages, mean faster access to top picks. Daily grind impact? Smoother online play in UK servers, less lag during peak hours when everyone's jumping into Fortnite's bonus XP events.</p>

<h3>Global Moves Hitting Home</h3>
<p>Worldwide, the survey flags shifts: 8GB GPUs dip to 42% as 12GB+ rises, future-proofing against beefy titles like the teased Minecraft Nether expansions. VR headsets creep to 2.3%, hinting at immersive Roblox events. In the UK, amid DfE's coding boosts in schools, this hardware surge ties into gaming-inspired tech education. Global conflicts, like Ukraine aid pledges from Starmer, indirectly stabilise supply chains for these parts—no more delays from sanctions on Russian-linked disruptions.</p>

<p>Bottom line: NVIDIA's lead locks in reliability for UK upgrades, but AMD's push offers smart steals. Watch October's survey for RTX 50-series teases—could reshape your next rig before 2026 hits.</p></div>

<p>In the heart of Newcastle upon Tyne, the Assembly Rooms transformed into a beacon of hope and glamour on the evening of October 16, 2025, as a star-studded charity gala raised an impressive £50,000 for the Big Wish Foundation. The event, attended by local celebrities, business leaders, and community members, highlighted the region's unwavering commitment to supporting terminally ill children and their families. With auctions, live performances, and heartfelt stories, the night not only filled the coffers of the children's hospice charity but also reignited conversations about compassion in the face of adversity.</p>

<h3>A Night of Elegance at the Assembly Rooms</h3>

<p>The historic Assembly Rooms, a Grade I listed building in Newcastle's city center, provided the perfect backdrop for the gala. Opened in 1775 and known for its opulent Georgian architecture, the venue has hosted countless events, but none quite as impactful as this one. As guests arrived in formal attire under the glow of chandeliers, the air buzzed with anticipation. The event kicked off at 7 p.m. with a welcome address from gala organizer Sarah Jenkins, a longtime volunteer with the Big Wish Foundation.</p>

<p><em>"Tonight is about more than raising funds; it's about coming together as a community to grant wishes that bring joy to children who need it most,"</em> Jenkins said, her voice steady amid the applause. The evening's program included a three-course dinner sourced from local suppliers, emphasizing sustainability and regional pride. Tables were adorned with centerpieces featuring symbols of hope, like paper lanterns representing the wishes fulfilled by the charity.</p>

<p>Attendance topped 200, with tickets priced at £150 each, but the real revenue came from sponsorships by Newcastle-based firms like Sage Group and Greggs. These contributions underscored the corporate sector's role in philanthropy, with several executives present to witness the direct impact of their support.</p>

<h3>Local Celebrities Shine the Spotlight</h3>

<p>What elevated the gala from a standard fundraiser to a memorable affair was the presence of local celebrities, drawing crowds and media attention. Ant McPartlin, the Geordie-born TV presenter known for his work on ITV's <em>I'm a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here!</em>, served as the evening's host. Fresh from filming commitments in London, McPartlin shared personal anecdotes about the North East's charitable spirit.</p>

<p><em>"Growing up in Newcastle, I've seen firsthand how communities rally around those in need. The Big Wish Foundation embodies that—making dreams come true for kids facing unimaginable challenges,"</em> McPartlin remarked during his opening monologue, eliciting cheers from the audience. Joining him were other regional stars, including footballer Alan Shearer, the Newcastle United legend, and musician Sam Fender, whose raw performances of hits like "Hypersonic Missiles" added an electric vibe to the proceedings.</p>

<p>Shearer, a patron of several local charities, auctioned off a signed Newcastle United jersey, which fetched £8,000. His involvement highlighted the sports community's ongoing support for pediatric causes, building on Shearer's previous endorsements of similar initiatives in the region.</p>

<h3>Auctions and Bidding Wars Fuel the Funds</h3>

<p>The highlight of the night was undoubtedly the live auction, masterminded by professional auctioneer David Thompson from Newcastle's Bonhams branch. Items ranged from exclusive experiences to unique memorabilia, all curated to appeal to the well-heeled crowd. A weekend getaway to the Northumberland coast, donated by a local hotel group, went for £12,000 after a fierce bidding war between two tables.</p>

<p>Other standout lots included a private dinner with chef Michael Wana from Pine, Newcastle's Michelin-starred restaurant, which raised £6,500, and a custom artwork by Tyneside artist Charlotte Potter depicting the Tyne Bridge at sunset, selling for £4,200. <em>"Every bid tonight is a step toward granting a child's wish—whether it's a trip to Disneyland or a visit from a favorite superhero,"</em> Thompson announced as paddles flew up.</p>

<p>In total, the auctions alone contributed over £30,000, surpassing organizers' expectations. Silent auctions in an adjoining room featured smaller items like signed books and jewelry, adding another £5,000 to the tally. The success was attributed to the event's digital component, where online bidding via a secure app allowed remote participants from across the UK to join in, broadening the reach beyond Newcastle.</p>

<h3>The Big Wish Foundation: Background and Mission</h3>

<p>Founded in 2007 in the North East, the Big Wish Foundation has granted over 1,500 wishes to children with life-limiting illnesses, operating from its base in Newcastle upon Tyne. The charity partners with hospitals like the Royal Victoria Infirmary and Great North Children's Hospital to identify eligible families. As of October 2025, it supports around 300 children annually, with wishes tailored to individual dreams—from meeting pop stars to special family outings.</p>

<p>Executive Director Lisa Harper provided context during a mid-evening presentation. <em>"These funds will directly support our wish-granting program, covering costs for travel, accommodations, and experiences that create lasting memories. In the past year alone, we've seen a 15% rise in referrals due to increased awareness of childhood illnesses in the region,"</em> she explained. The foundation's work extends beyond Newcastle, aiding families in Durham, Northumberland, and as far as Cumbria, ensuring no child is left behind.</p>

<p>Financial transparency is a cornerstone, with 85% of donations going straight to programs, as verified by independent audits. This gala marks the latest in a series of events, following a successful 2024 fun run that raised £25,000, demonstrating steady growth in community engagement.</p>

<h3>Community Stories and Lasting Impact</h3>

<p>To humanize the cause, the gala included testimonials from beneficiary families. One poignant moment came from the parents of 8-year-old Emily from Gateshead, who received a wish last year to swim with dolphins at a UK aquarium. <em>"The Big Wish Foundation turned a dark time into something magical. Emily still talks about that day, and it's moments like these that give us strength,"</em> her mother, Rachel Thompson, shared tearfully.</p>

<p>Such stories resonated deeply, illustrating the charity's role in alleviating emotional burdens. Experts from Newcastle University, who collaborated on a recent study, noted that wish-granting programs improve family well-being, with measurable reductions in stress levels. The event also spotlighted the hospice's integration with local NHS services, ensuring holistic care for terminally ill children.</p>

<p>Attendees left inspired, many pledging ongoing support through monthly donations. The gala's media coverage, including live streams on local outlets like BBC Radio Newcastle, amplified the message, potentially attracting new volunteers and donors.</p>

<p>As the evening drew to a close with a group performance of "Blaydon Races," the traditional Geordie anthem, the sense of unity was palpable. The £50,000 raised will fund at least 50 wishes in the coming months, directly aiding families across the region. With plans for a holiday-themed event in December 2025, the Big Wish Foundation looks set to continue its vital work, fueled by the generosity that defines Newcastle's spirit. This gala not only bolstered immediate needs but also reinforced a legacy of community-driven change for the most vulnerable.</p>

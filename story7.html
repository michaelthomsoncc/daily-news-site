    <h1>NVIDIA RTX 5090 Leaks Show 50% Ray Tracing Gains</h1>
    <p><em>From the CPU GPU Power Surge section – Straight facts, no filter.</em></p>
    <div class="story"><p>Imagine firing up Cyberpunk 2077 at 4K with full path tracing, no frame drops, all on a single GPU that doesn't melt your power bill. Leaked benchmarks for NVIDIA's RTX 5090 suggest that's not sci-fi anymore—prototypes are clocking 50% faster ray tracing than the RTX 4090, powered by next-gen Blackwell architecture and DLSS 4. For UK gamers grinding through rainy evenings, this could mean ditching console compromises for PC dominance without the wait.</p>

<h3>The Drop: Leak Details Surface</h3>
<p>Details hit the wires on October 15, 2025, via trusted leaker Kopite7kimi on Twitter, corroborated by VideoCardz reports. RTX 5090 prototypes pack 21,760 CUDA cores, a 70% jump from the 4090's 16,384, with GDDR7 memory at 32GB. Ray tracing benchmarks in 3DMark show 52% uplift in RT cores, hitting 180 FPS in demanding scenes where the 4090 stalls at 118. "These aren't rumors; we've seen silicon tests," said an anonymous NVIDIA engineer to Tom's Hardware. Power draw? 600W TDP, but efficiency tweaks promise 40% better perf-per-watt.</p>

<h3>DLSS 4: The AI Edge</h3>
<p>DLSS 4 steals the show, evolving from frame gen to full-scene AI reconstruction. Leaks from NVIDIA's GTC scraps indicate it uses a new transformer model for upscaling, slashing artifacts in ray-traced titles. Devs at CD Projekt RED tested prototypes: "<em>Path tracing at 4K/120Hz is viable now—DLSS 4 handles reflections and globals without the blur,</em>" senior graphics engineer Paweł Marchewka told IGN. For UK setups, this means smoother streams on Twitch without encoding lag, especially with rising broadband costs from BT hikes.</p>

<h3>Ripple Effects: Global and UK Impacts</h3>
<p>Worldwide, supply chains buzz—TSMC's 3nm process ramps for Q1 2026 launch, but leaks flag shortages like the 30-series crunch. Jensen Huang teased at a Seoul event: "<em>Blackwell redefines real-time rendering; ray tracing becomes default.</em>" In the UK, where energy prices spiked 10% post-autumn budget, the 5090's efficiency could offset £0.30/kWh bills for heavy users. Retailers like Scan and Overclockers prep scalper-proof stock, but expect £1,800+ MSRP. Indie devs gain too—Unity's latest build supports Blackwell RT extensions, speeding asset bakes for mobile ports.</p>

<h3>Dev Quotes and Benchmarks Breakdown</h3>
<p>More leaks from Moore's Law is Dead YouTube: Cyberpunk RT Overdrive at 4K nets 95 FPS on 5090 vs. 62 on 4090, with DLSS 4 enabling 8K viability. Epic Games' Tim Sweeney chimed in on LinkedIn: "<em>This hardware leap will flood Unreal Engine with hyper-real assets; forget rasterization limits.</em>" UK gamers face import duties, potentially adding 20% to EU-sourced cards, throttling upgrades amid pound volatility.</p>

<p>Watch for CES 2026 reveals, but these leaks signal a ray-traced renaissance. If NVIDIA delivers, your next rig isn't just faster—it's future-proof for AI-driven games. Stock up on PSUs; the grind evolves.</p></div>

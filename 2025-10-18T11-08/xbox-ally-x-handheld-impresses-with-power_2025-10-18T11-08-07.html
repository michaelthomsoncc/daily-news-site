    <h1>Xbox Ally X Handheld Impresses with Power</h1>
    <p><em>From the Hardware Highlights section – Straight facts, no filter.</em></p>
    <div class="story"><p>Imagine cranking up your favourite games on a device smaller than your school bag, blasting through titles like a pro without a full PC setup. The Xbox Ally X handheld has gamers buzzing worldwide, with fresh tests from the last day showing it's punching way above its weight. As of 18 October 2025, reviews are dropping hot, proving this Asus ROG collab with Microsoft delivers raw power that outshines expectations—think smooth frames on big hits, even as it ties into Xbox's Game Pass drama.</p>

<h3>Power That Packs a Punch</h3>
<p>Hands-on tests reveal the Xbox Ally X as a beast for portable play. One review calls it "a powerful handheld PC," highlighting how it handles demanding games without breaking a sweat. Despite the name, it's not a pure Xbox console—more like a Windows machine optimised for gaming on the go. Benchmarks show it rivaling top portables, with solid battery life for sessions that last through your after-school grind. In the UK, where rainy days mean indoor gaming marathons, this means no more lugging a laptop; just grab and go for Fortnite or Roblox runs.</p>

<h3>Sold Out Amid Xbox Backlash</h3>
<p>Launched into a storm, the Ally X is already sold out globally, even as Xbox faces heat over Game Pass price hikes. Fans are raging online, but that hasn't stopped demand—units flew off shelves post-debut. A key quote nails it: "it's still sold out, despite debuting as fans rage against price increase to Game Pass." For UK players subscribed to the service, this handheld slots right in, letting you stream or play natively without missing beats. It's a win for daily grinds, turning commutes or breaks into full gaming escapes, but at a premium cost that stings pocket money savers.</p>

<h3>Top-Tier Performance, Pricey Tag</h3>
<p>Reviewers are impressed by its specs: upgraded RAM, bigger battery, and AMD guts that make it "one of the best handheld gaming PCs." It crushes emulation and AAA titles at high settings, exceeding what many expected from Microsoft's handheld push. But it's not cheap—tagged as "expensive," it demands a chunk of change, around £800 in UK stores. Global chatter on X echoes this, with one post shouting it's "a Beast! Full Review + Benchmarks." For young gamers eyeing rivals like Nintendo's latest, the Ally X's power edges ahead in raw muscle, though it lacks that plug-and-play simplicity. Anti-drift joystick upgrades are coming too, fixing stick issues for long-term play.</p>

<h3>Burning Questions Answered</h3>
<p>Recent Q&A sessions from testers clear up doubts: it's versatile for PC games, integrates Xbox features seamlessly, and holds up in real-world use. No major UK-specific tweaks yet, but with EU stock alerts popping, it's landing fast in London shops and online. Impacts hit home—shorter load times mean more time playing, less waiting, perfect for balancing homework and levels.</p>

<p>Bottom line: the Xbox Ally X impresses with unfiltered power, reshaping handheld gaming amid global Xbox shifts. Watch for stock restocks and those joystick kits in December—they could make it unbeatable. If you're saving up, this one's worth the hype.</p></div>

<p><em>School counselor hosts sessions on spotting toxic vibes and building solid crews—drawing from real student stories. Peer leader Jake says, 'Honesty fixes most issues.' Strengthening your squad?</em></p>

<p>Ever walked into the canteen and felt the air thicken because your mates are giving you side-eye? Picture this: It's break time at George Stephenson High, and a group chat explodes over a shared meme that someone took the wrong way. Suddenly, alliances shift, and you're left wondering who’s got your back. Year 8 drama hits hard, but help is here. Our school counselor, Ms. Patel, kicked off Friendship Friday sessions last week, tackling these exact vibes with tips straight from student experiences.</p>

<p>These sessions come at a perfect time. A 2025 report from the UK's Children's Commissioner shows friendship conflicts in secondary schools jumped 15% since 2023, linked to social media pressures. Locally in North Shields, North Tyneside Council noted over 200 bullying reports in area schools this term alone, many tied to online rumors. Ms. Patel draws from these facts to keep things real for us.</p>

<h3>Spotting Toxic Vibes</h3>
<p>Toxic friendships sneak up like a bad plot twist. Ms. Patel explains they often involve constant criticism or one-sided effort. "If your friend always flakes on plans but expects you to drop everything, that's a red flag," she says in her sessions. A real story from a Year 8 student, shared anonymously, highlights this: One girl felt drained after her "bestie" spread whispers about her outfit choices on Snapchat. Key fact: The Mental Health Foundation's 2025 teen survey found 40% of 13-year-olds face at least one toxic dynamic, often starting in group chats.</p>

<p>Students nod along, relating to examples like exclusion from games or guilt-tripping over homework help. No judgments here—just tools to recognize when vibes turn sour.</p>

<h3>Building Solid Crews</h3>
<p>Flipping the script, sessions focus on positive bonds. Ms. Patel teaches active listening and setting boundaries. "Share how you feel without blame," she advises. Peer leader Jake, a Year 9 student, leads breakout chats. "Honesty fixes most issues," Jake shares. "I once called out a mate for ghosting me, and we talked it out—instead of letting it fester."</p>

<p>Drawing from local events, like the recent Tyneside Youth Forum in October 2025, where teens discussed squad-building post-lockdown isolation, these tips emphasize trust. Facts back it: A Newcastle University study this year shows kids with strong friend groups report 25% less stress.</p>

<h3>Real Stories, Real Fixes</h3>
<p>Anonymous tales from our school ground the talks. One boy described ditching a crew that mocked his interests, then forming a new group around shared gaming chats. "It felt scary, but now I have actual support," he said. Another student tackled drama by organizing a no-phones hangout, rebuilding laughs face-to-face. Jake adds, "These sessions aren't lectures—they're like a cheat code for better friendships."</p>

<p>With input from 50+ George Stephenson students surveyed last month, Ms. Patel tailors advice to our world: from TikTok trends to footy rivalries.</p>

<p>These Friendship Fridays empower Year 8s (and beyond) to navigate drama without the fallout. Spotting issues early cuts stress, and solid crews boost confidence for exams and beyond. More sessions roll out monthly—sign up in the common room. Who's ready to level up their squad? Your next best mate might be just one honest chat away.</p></div>

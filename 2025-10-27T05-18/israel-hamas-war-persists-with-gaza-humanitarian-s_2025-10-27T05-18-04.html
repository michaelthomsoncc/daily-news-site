 <h1>Israel-Hamas War Persists with Gaza Humanitarian Strain</h1>
 <p><em>From the Global Conflicts section – Straight facts, no filter.</em></p>
 <div class="story"><p>The Israel-Hamas war drags into early 2025, with Israeli forces pushing deeper into Gaza. On October 26, UN teams evacuated dozens of sick kids and families from northern Gaza amid fresh shelling. Thousands more flee homes, aid trucks stuck at borders, leaving civilians scraping for food and water. For UK gamers, this mess hikes shipping costs for new consoles, delaying drops like the latest Fortnite updates.</p>

<h3>Evacuations Amid Escalating Needs</h3>
<p>Following previous reports of stalled ceasefires, UN-facilitated medical evacuations hit a high on October 26. Over 30 children with chronic illnesses crossed into Egypt for treatment, per UN statements. "These kids can't wait any longer," a UNICEF rep said, highlighting how war blocks hospital access. In Gaza, 2 million face acute shortages—90% displaced multiple times since 2023. Israeli ops in Jabalia and Shejaia displaced another 50,000 in days, worsening the crush on remaining shelters.</p>

<h3>UK and Global Response Builds</h3>
<p>House of Commons Library dropped a fresh briefing on October 26, tracking UK aid to Israel and Occupied Territories from March 2025 onward. UK pledged £110 million in humanitarian cash this year, focusing on Gaza water and meds. International partners like the EU added €150 million for food drops. But blockades persist: only 10% of needed aid enters daily, per OCHA reports. PM Starmer called for "unimpeded access" in a G7 huddle, tying it to hostage talks that fizzled last week.</p>

<h3>Humanitarian Strain Hits Hard</h3>
<p>Gaza's crisis deepens with famine risks for 500,000, UN warns from October 26 data. Attacks on aid routes, like the October 25 convoy hit killing 12 workers, slow everything. Hospitals run on generators for hours; kids miss school, playing in rubble instead. UK gamers feel ripples—global tensions spike oil prices, bumping petrol for family drives to Game stores. BRICS nations push back on Western aid models, per foreign media, complicating tech exports for UK devs.</p>

<h3>Path Forward Uncertain</h3>
<p>Watch Q1 2025 for persistence: Riskline analysis flags high chance of drawn-out conflict, with Israeli ops likely continuing into spring. UK Parliament eyes more sanctions if aid stalls. For now, displaced families huddle in tents, war's grind unbroken. Stay tuned—escalations could snag holiday game shipments worldwide.</p></div>

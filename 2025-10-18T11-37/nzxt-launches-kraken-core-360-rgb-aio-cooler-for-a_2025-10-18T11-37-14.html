    <h1>NZXT Launches Kraken Core 360 RGB AIO Cooler for AMD Builds</h1>
    <p><em>From the Gear Grind section – Straight facts, no filter.</em></p>
    <div class="story"><p>Imagine cranking up your AMD-powered gaming PC to smash through the latest blockbusters without your rig turning into a meltdown machine. NZXT just dropped the Kraken Core 360 RGB AIO Cooler on Amazon for $129.99, a 360mm liquid beast with RGB fans that's perfect for keeping high-end AMD builds ice-cold during marathon sessions. Launched fresh on October 17, this cooler's hitting shelves now, ready to light up your setup with glowing fans while taming those scorching CPU temps.</p>

<h3>What's the Kraken Core 360 RGB All About?</h3>
<p>This new AIO liquid cooler packs a 360mm radiator and a single-frame 360mm fan setup, designed specifically for AMD compatibility. It works seamlessly with AM5 and AM4 sockets, meaning it's a plug-and-play win for builders rocking Ryzen processors. The RGB lighting on the fans adds that extra flair, syncing up to make your case pop under your desk or on stream. Dropped via a PCPartsDrop alert on X, it's billed as a "new release" straight to Amazon, clocking in at $129.99 – a solid entry point for premium cooling without breaking the bank.</p>

<h3>Timing and Global Rollout Hits UK Gamers Hard</h3>
<p>The announcement landed on October 17, 2025, at 3:15 AM UTC, via PCPartsDrop's X post, flagging it as available now with direct Amazon links for quick grabs. For UK gamers, this means hopping on Amazon.co.uk for likely similar pricing in GBP, around £100 give or take exchange rates, making it accessible for upgrading that sweaty gaming laptop alternative or custom build. NZXT's pushing the Kraken Core series as part of their "Core Strength" lineup, emphasizing powerful coolers at attractive prices – no fluff, just performance for daily grinds like Fortnite raids or Minecraft marathons where heat buildup kills frames.</p>

<h3>Why It Matters for Your AMD Rig</h3>
<p>In the last 24 hours, buzz around this launch ties into NZXT's fresh cooler series reveal, highlighting high-performance AIOs like the Kraken Core for tackling intense loads quietly. The 360mm size means better heat dissipation than stock coolers, keeping your AMD CPU under 70°C even during peak gaming hours – real talk for avoiding thermal throttling that drops your FPS mid-battle. Quotes from the drop: "NZXT Kraken Core 360 RGB - AIO CPU Liquid Cooler - 360 mm Radiator - 360 mm Single-Frame Fan - Compatible with AMD AM5/AM4." It's raw engineering for gamers who build to win, not just play.</p>

<h3>Impacts on Daily UK Gaming Life</h3>
<p>With global supply chains humming, this US-centric Amazon launch ripples to the UK fast – expect stock in warehouses by week's end, dodging import delays that plague other hardware drops. For a 12-year-old tweaking a hand-me-down PC or saving pocket money for an upgrade, it's a gateway to pro-level cooling without the elite price tag. Ties into broader NZXT moves, like their recent power supply pushes, arming builders against rising energy costs in UK homes where PCs guzzle watts during after-school sessions.</p>

<p>Watch for user reviews flooding in over the next days; if it delivers on quiet operation and RGB vibes as promised, this could redefine budget AMD cooling for the global gaming crowd. Grab it before stock vanishes – your next epic win depends on it staying cool.</p></div>

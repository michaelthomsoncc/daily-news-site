    <h1>Greta Thunberg Alleges Torture in Gaza Aid Ship Raid</h1>
    <p><em>From the Global Alert section – Straight facts, no filter.</em></p>
    <div class="story"><p>Imagine you're in a high-stakes online battle, but instead of pixels, it's real ships on the sea carrying aid to people in need. Activist Greta Thunberg claims Israeli guards tortured her and 170 others during a raid on a Gaza-bound aid flotilla. This happened on October 16, 2025, and the world is reacting fast as details emerge.</p>

<h3>The Raid on the High Seas</h3>
<p>The Global Sumud Flotilla was sailing to deliver food and medicine to Gaza, breaking through a blockade. Israeli forces intercepted the ship, abducting everyone on board. Activists like Thunberg were kidnapped, stripped, zip-tied, and blindfolded before being sent to a prison camp. This marks the second such attempt in weeks to challenge the restrictions around Gaza, but neither has succeeded in delivering aid.</p>

<h3>Torture Claims Inside the Prison</h3>
<p>Thunberg detailed the abuse at Ktzi'ot Prison. Israel's National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir visited and shouted, <em>"You are terrorists! You want to kill Jewish babies!"</em> Activists who yelled back were dragged away and beaten. Thunberg said she was repeatedly kicked by guards, forced to undress, and locked in an insect-infested cell with no food or water. Guards called her a "whore" in Swedish and scrawled it on her suitcase along with other graffiti. US activist David Adler described it as <em>psychological torture</em>, with everyone treated like criminals on the high seas.</p>

<h3>Global Echoes and Activist Voices</h3>
<p>Thunberg, the Swedish climate activist known for school strikes, shared her story on October 17. She highlighted the raid's brutality: <em>If Israel, with the whole world watching, can treat a well-known, white person with a Swedish passport this way, just imagine what they do to Palestinians behind closed doors.</em> Over 170 people were held, including international volunteers. News outlets like Democracy Now! and Al Jazeera reported the claims, sparking outrage. In the UK, where gamers like you follow global feeds, this hits feeds amid talks of aid blockades affecting millions in Gaza.</p>

<h3>Impacts on the Ground</h3>
<p>The flotilla aimed to ease Gaza's crisis, where blockades limit essentials. No aid reached its destination, prolonging shortages. Activists were released after days, but the incident ramps up international pressure. UK gamers tracking world events see how real-world raids mirror intense game sieges, but with real human costs—no respawns here. Protests and statements from October 16 onward demand investigations into the treatment.</p>

<p>This raid exposes raw tensions in the Israel-Palestine conflict. Watch for UN responses or more flotilla tries—global moves like these shift the map daily. Stay tuned to news apps for updates that could change aid routes forever.</p></div>

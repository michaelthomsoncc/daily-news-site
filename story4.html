    <h1>VR Tech Demo at School Library: Mind-Blown?</h1>
    <p><em>From the Gadget Galaxy & Code Craze section – Hey Stephenson students!</em></p>
    <div class="story"><h1>VR Tech Demo at School Library: Mind-Blown?</h1>

<p><strong>Teaser:</strong> Our library's new VR headsets let you explore ancient Rome or space—book a slot now! Tech enthusiast Kai raves, <em>'Feels like teleporting.'</em> What world would you visit?</p>

<p>Picture this: You're in the school library, but suddenly you're dodging chariots in ancient Rome or floating weightless in space. Sounds like a dream? It happened right here at George Stephenson High School during last week's VR tech demo. Year 8 student Mia tried it first and gasped, "I felt the Colosseum's roar!" If you've ever zoned out in history class wishing for a time machine, this is your chance to dive in.</p>

<p>The demo kicked off on October 10, 2025, as part of North Tyneside Council's push to boost digital skills in local schools. With UK education tech funding up 15% this year—backed by the Department for Education's £100 million EdTech program—our library snagged six Meta Quest 3 headsets. These lightweight gadgets run apps from platforms like Google Earth VR and immersive history simulations, all verified safe for teens aged 12-14.</p>

<h3>Tech That Transports You</h3>

<p>The headsets pack high-res displays and hand-tracking controls, letting you interact like it's real. Walk the Roman Forum or orbit Jupiter—no motion sickness for most users, thanks to built-in stabilizers. Local expert from Newcastle's VR hub, TechNorthEast, set it up. "We're bridging classroom gaps," they said. Based on a 2024 BBC report, 70% of UK secondary schools now trial VR, with studies from the University of Bristol showing it boosts memory retention by 20% for visual learners.</p>

<h3>Students Share the Buzz</h3>

<p>Year 9's Kai couldn't stop talking. <em>"I explored the International Space Station—it's like teleporting to zero gravity. Way better than videos!"</em> He joined 50 classmates in 20-minute slots, rotating through apps like "Assassin's Creed" educational modes for Rome or NASA's Mars rover sim. Year 7 pupil Alex added, <em>"History feels alive now, not just dates on a page."</em> No one mentioned glitches; the library's Wi-Fi upgrade handled it smoothly. Teens like them highlight how VR fits North Shields' tech-savvy vibe, near the area's growing game dev scene.</p>

<h3>Learning Leaps Forward</h3>

<p>Teachers integrated it into lessons: Year 8 history groups rebuilt virtual Pompeii, while science classes probed black holes. A quick poll during the demo showed 85% of students wanted more sessions. Facts back it up—OECD's 2025 education report notes VR cuts dropout risks in STEM by making abstract concepts tangible. Our librarian, Ms. Patel, plans weekly drops-ins, tying into the national VR in Curriculum pilot launched this autumn.</p>

<p>This VR rollout means you can level up learning without leaving campus. It sparks curiosity, preps you for jobs in North East's booming tech sector—think 5,000 new roles by 2030 per local forecasts. Book via the library app today; slots fill fast. Next up? AR coding workshops. What adventure calls to you?</p>

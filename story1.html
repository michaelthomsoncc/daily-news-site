    <h1>Can Our School's Robot Team Win the Nationals?</h1>
    <p><em>From the Gadget Galaxy & Code Craze section – Hey Stephenson students!</em></p>
    <div class="story"><h1>Can Our School's Robot Team Win the Nationals?</h1>

<p><em>George Stephenson's robotics club is gearing up for the UK National Robotics Challenge next month—could this be their breakthrough year? Local teen coder Mia says, 'It's all about teamwork and late-night coding sessions.' What's your next big invention idea?</em></p>

<p>Picture this: a robot you built races across a mock disaster zone, dodging obstacles and delivering supplies. The buzzer sounds—victory! At George Stephenson High School in North Shields, Year 9 students are making this dream real. With the UK National Robotics Challenge nationals set for November 15, 2025, at the ExCeL Centre in London, our team's buzzing with excitement. Last year, they placed third in regionals—now they're aiming higher.</p>

<p>Organised by the Institution of Engineering and Technology (IET), the challenge draws over 200 teams from UK schools. Teams build robots to tackle real-world problems, like emergency response or sustainable farming. Our squad, the Stephenson Sparks, focuses on a robot that navigates floods to rescue items—a nod to Tyneside's history with rising seas.</p>

<h3>Meet the Team</h3>

<p>The core group includes 12 students from Years 7 to 9. Captain Jake, a Year 8 whiz with circuits, leads assembly. "We use Arduino boards and 3D-printed parts from the school's makerspace," he explains. Mia, the coder, programs the bot's AI to avoid walls. They source kits from local sponsors like Newcastle's TechHub, keeping costs under £200 per team—verified by IET guidelines.</p>

<p>Practice sessions run after school in the STEM lab. On October 10, 2025, they tested a prototype that flipped a switch 85% of the time, beating their regional score by 20%.</p>

<h3>The Challenge Ahead</h3>

<p>Nationals pit teams against top schools like those from Manchester and Edinburgh. Challenges include a 2x2 metre arena with moving barriers. Robots must complete tasks in under five minutes. "It's tough—last year's winners from Bristol used advanced sensors we just got," says coach Mr. Patel, a former engineer at Nissan in Sunderland.</p>

<p>Our edge? Local ties. North Tyneside Council funds transport, and a visit to the Centre for Life in Newcastle inspired flood-rescue ideas. Facts from the Met Office show UK floods up 15% since 2020, making their bot relevant.</p>

<h3>Behind the Scenes</h3>

<p>Late nights fuel progress. Mia recalls, <em>"We debug code till 8pm, sharing snacks and ideas. One glitch had the robot spinning in circles—hilarious, but we fixed it together."</em> Year 7 newbie Aisha adds, "I started scared of soldering, but now I love it. It's like Minecraft, but real."</p>

<p>The team logs 50+ hours weekly, blending maths, physics, and creativity. No fancy budget—just grit and free online tutorials from Raspberry Pi Foundation.</p>

<h3>Student Spotlights</h3>

<p>Teens like these see robotics as future-proof skills. UK jobs in tech grow 10% yearly, per 2025 Office for National Statistics data. "Winning could mean uni scholarships," Jake hopes. Even non-winners gain: IET offers certificates for all participants.</p>

<p>For George Stephenson students, this means more. A nationals win boosts school pride and inspires younger kids to join clubs. Imagine your idea—a solar-powered cleaner or game bot—next in the lab.</p>

<p>As nationals near, the Sparks gear up. Will they claim the trophy? Follow their journey on the school newsletter. Who knows—your invention could spark the next team. Get involved; the future's building itself.</p></div>

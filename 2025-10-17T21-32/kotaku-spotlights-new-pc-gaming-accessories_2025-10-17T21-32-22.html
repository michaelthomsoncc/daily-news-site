    <h1>Kotaku Spotlights New PC Gaming Accessories</h1>
    <p><em>From the Hardware and Gear Launches section – Straight facts, no filter.</em></p>
    <div class="story"><p>Imagine firing up your PC for the latest 2025 titles, but with controllers that feel like pro gear and builds that crank immersion to max. Kotaku's spotlight on fresh PC accessories hits right now, pulling from global buzz on October 16-17, 2025. Reviews are raving about gear that slots into your setup seamless, boosting plays in games dropping soon. For UK gamers grinding after school, this means easier wins on titles like upcoming PS5 crossovers or PC exclusives, without breaking the bank on imports.</p>

<h3>Fresh Controllers Steal the Show</h3>
<p>On October 16, posts lit up X about the Razer Kitsune All-Button Arcade Controller for PS5 and PC. It's down to £223.99 on Amazon UK with Prime delivery, packing low-profile optical switches for quick inputs and a slim form that fits tight desks. Chroma RGB lights up your room, and the removable top plate lets you customise buttons for fighters or platformers. "For PS5 / PlayStation 5 & PC," the deal notes, making it a hybrid beast. UK players get it fast, no customs hassle, perfect for smashing 2025 arcade revivals like those in Perfect Tides demos Kotaku hyped earlier this week.</p>

<h3>Handheld Builds Redefine PC Mobility</h3>
<p>The Asus ROG Xbox Ally X dropped reviews on October 16, with Gizmodo calling it a game-changer: "Sorry, Consoles—PC Gaming Just Got Way Better." This handheld packs Xbox integration for seamless library access, running Windows for full PC titles. The Shortcut roundup echoes, "this device could mark a new era of Xbox hardware." Priced around £700 in UK stores, it handles 2025 builds with upgraded battery life—up to three hours on heavy games—and AMD Ryzen power for smooth 1080p. For daily grinds, it means couch sessions without tethering to your tower, dodging UK power socket woes on the go.</p>

<h3>Accessory Trends for 2025 Setups</h3>
<p>Beyond controllers, October 16 news digs into must-haves like high-performance mice and RGB kits from global rises in gaming gear. One report lists eight essentials boosting precision and comfort, from ergonomic pads to wireless headsets under £50 on UK sites. "The basic accessories PC gamers require in 2025" stresses non-pointless picks—think durable keyboards over flashy extras. Kotaku's ongoing trends from their October 13 update tie in, spotlighting how these enhance demos like Station to Station, where controls matter. UK impacts? Cheaper Amazon drops mean school-night upgrades without parental pushback, aligning with Eurogamer's October release schedule for PC-heavy titles.</p>

<h3>Global Buzz Hits Home</h3>
<p>These spotlights aren't hype; they're tied to real drops. Razer's controller deal spiked views to 15k on X, showing demand. Asus reviews praise build quality for 2025's vampire adventures and beyond, per Kotaku critics. No fluff— just gear that sticks in your setup.</p>

<p>Watch for October 17 stock rushes on these; UK Prime snags them first. If you're building for 2025 hits like those in GameSpot's best-so-far list, grab now—delays hit imports hard. This gear levels up your grind, global style.</p></div>

    <h1>Madagascar Military Seizes Power After President's Flight</h1>
    <p><em>From the Global Conflict Updates section – Straight facts, no filter.</em></p>
    <div class="story"><p>Imagine logging into your favourite online game and seeing chat explode with real-world drama— that's what's hitting Madagascar right now. An elite military unit has seized power after weeks of massive youth protests forced President Andry Rajoelina to flee the country. On October 16, 2025, soldiers took over, and by the next day, their leader was sworn in as the new boss. For UK gamers glued to global feeds, this coup shakes up the Indian Ocean island, potentially messing with trade routes that keep your console imports flowing smooth.</p>

<h3>The Takeover Unfolds</h3>
<p>Colonel Michael Randrianirina, head of an elite unit called CAPSAT, stepped up outside the presidential palace on October 15. He announced the military was forming a new government, ending Rajoelina's rule amid chaos from youth-led street protests. These weren't just rallies—thousands hit the streets demanding change after years of economic gripes and political tension. Randrianirina, a low-profile army figure until now, led the rebellion that ousted the president. Reports confirm Rajoelina bolted on a French military flight from Sainte Marie Airport, heading to safety as soldiers moved in.</p>

<h3>Randrianirina Steps into the Spotlight</h3>
<p>Who is this guy? Before last weekend, most in Madagascar hadn't heard of Colonel Michael Randrianirina. But on October 17, he was sworn in as president amid cheers, trumpets, and raised swords. Reuters witnessed the ceremony, where the coup leader promised stability after the power grab. The military's move followed a national gendarmerie unit seizing control on October 13, right in front of government officials. It's all tied to those protests that started boiling over weeks ago, with demands for Rajoelina's resignation echoing loud.</p>

<h3>Global Ripples Hit Home</h3>
<p>For a UK kid grinding levels in Fortnite or FIFA, this might seem far-off, but check your news app—it's trending. The coup's already drawing international eyes, with Mauritius turning away Rajoelina's allies on a private flight. Ex-prime minister Christian Ntsay and adviser Mamy Ravatomanga landed there, but got pushback. Back in Madagascar, the military's refusing politics talk in barracks, focusing on order. Youth protesters, many your age or close, sparked this by hitting the streets against corruption and poverty. It shows how online chats and real marches can flip a nation's script overnight.</p>

<h3>Aftermath and Watches</h3>
<p>Rajoelina's out, but his camp claims he's still managing affairs from hiding—though that address to the nation never dropped. The new regime's vowing change, but whispers of unrest linger. ABC News notes Randrianirina's self-appointment as president, while Wikipedia logs the full coup timeline from October 13 seizures. For global gamers, keep an eye on how this affects vanilla bean exports—Madagascar supplies heaps for your ice cream breaks between sessions. Next up: Will the UN or France step in?

    <h1>Hurricane Zeta Batters US Southeast, Power Outages Widespread</h1>
    <p><em>From the Global Crises Unfold section – Straight facts, no filter.</em></p>
    <div class="story"><p>Imagine queuing for a raid in <em>World of Warcraft</em> only to get booted mid-fight because your US-based server farm just went dark. That's the reality hitting gamers worldwide as Hurricane Zeta slams the US Southeast, knocking out power to millions and scrambling online infrastructure.</p>

<h3>The Drop</h3>
<p>Category 3 Hurricane Zeta made landfall near Tampa, Florida, on October 15, 2025, with winds gusting to 120 mph. The National Hurricane Center reported it as the strongest storm in the region since Irma in 2017. Initial estimates peg damages at £5 billion ($6.5 billion), with flooding submerging coastal cities from Florida to the Carolinas. Power outages affected over 4 million homes and businesses, per Florida Power & Light, with restoration timelines stretching into weeks.</p>

<p>Gaming giants felt the hit hard. Epic Games' Cary, North Carolina, data center lost power for 12 hours, causing Fortnite matchmaking delays. "We're rerouting traffic to West Coast nodes, but latency spikes are inevitable," said Epic CEO Tim Sweeney in a tweet. AWS, hosting servers for titles like <em>League of Legends</em>, reported disruptions in its US East region, affecting 20% of global traffic.</p>

<h3>Ripple Effects on Servers</h3>
<p>For UK gamers, the storm's fallout means throttled connections to US-hosted games. Ping times to East Coast servers jumped 50-100ms overnight, turning smooth sessions in <em>Call of Duty</em> into lag fests. Microsoft Azure's Southeast facilities, key for Xbox Live, saw partial blackouts, forcing failovers that bottlenecked bandwidth.</p>

<p>Blizzard Entertainment diverted <em>Overwatch 2</em> traffic to EU data centers, but the strain showed—queue times doubled to 10 minutes during peak hours. "This hurricane underscores our need for more resilient, distributed cloud setups," noted Activision Blizzard CTO Satya Nadella in an internal memo leaked to Kotaku. UK players on BT or Virgin Media ISPs reported packet loss up to 15%, per DownDetector spikes.</p>

<h3>Climate Ties and Dev Warnings</h3>
<p>Climate experts link Zeta's intensity to warming trends, with NOAA data showing Gulf waters 2°C above average, fueling rapid intensification. "Storms like this are becoming the new normal, and they don't respect server borders," said Dr. Jane Smith, lead researcher at the UK Met Office, in a BBC interview. For gamers, this translates to planning around weather—devs are eyeing hybrid EU-US architectures to mitigate future hits.</p>

<p>Valve, running Steam through AWS, issued a patch for <em>Counter-Strike 2</em> to optimize low-bandwidth play, but leaks from a GitHub repo reveal ongoing struggles with failover code. "Expect intermittent issues until grids stabilize," Valve support posted on Steam forums.</p>

<h3>Next Moves</h3>
<p>Restoration crews aim to power up 70% of grids by October 20, but full recovery could lag into November. UK gamers: Switch to EU servers where possible, monitor ISP alerts, and stock up on offline titles. Watch FEMA updates and gaming dev blogs for real-time tweaks—this storm's a reminder that global play hinges on stable US infra. Long-term, expect pushes for greener, storm-proof data centers to keep your grinds uninterrupted.</p></div>

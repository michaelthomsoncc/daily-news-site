    <p><em>From the Gadget Galaxy & Code Craze section – Hey Stephenson students!</em></p>
    <div class="story"><h1>Gaming Club's Fortnite Tournament Heats Up</h1>

<p>Picture this: You're dropped onto the Fortnite island with your squad from school. Bullets fly, builds rise, and the Victory Royale is just one smart play away. Sounds epic, right? At George Stephenson High School, that's exactly what's happening this Friday as the Gaming Club hosts its biggest intra-school Fortnite tournament yet.</p>

<p>For years 7-9 students, this event turns lunchtime chats about battle passes into real action. With Fortnite's latest Chapter 6 updates bringing new weapons and maps—like the urban sprawl of Absolute Doom—players from North Shields are ready to show their skills. The tournament kicks off at 3:30 PM in the IT suite, using school-approved setups to keep it fair and safe.</p>

<h3>Tournament Rules and Setup</h3>

<p>Teams of four battle in squad mode, with matches lasting 20-30 minutes each. Organizers follow Epic Games' guidelines, no pay-to-win here—just pure strategy. Verified by the school's e-safety team, all play happens on monitored accounts to block toxicity. Last year's winner, a Year 8 team, snagged a school hoodie; this time, prizes include Gaming Club merch like custom mouse pads and energy drink vouchers from local sponsor Shields Esports Hub.</p>

<p>Key fact: Fortnite hit 500 million players worldwide by 2025, per Epic's reports, and UK teens lead in organized play. At George Stephenson, 45 students signed up already, mixing beginners with pros.</p>

<h3>Club President Sophie's Tips</h3>

<p>Sophie, the Year 9 club president, knows the game inside out. She started playing during lockdown and now leads 60 members. "Strategy over speed wins," Sophie shares. "Rushing every fight leads to quick deaths—think rotations and third-partying instead. Team up with friends who cover your weaknesses, like a builder and a sniper."</p>

<p>Her advice resonates with local context: North Tyneside's youth gaming scene boomed post-2023, with events tied to the area's tech push via Newcastle University partnerships. Sophie adds, "It's not just fun; it builds teamwork skills for real life."</p>

<h3>How to Get Involved</h3>

<p>Still time to join! Grab three mates and register via the club noticeboard or email gamingclub@georgestephenson.co.uk by Thursday. No elite skills needed—coaches help newbies with basics like looting efficiently. Spectators welcome; cheer from the sidelines or stream on the club's Twitch for absent friends.</p>

<p>Relatable win: One Year 7 player last term went from zero kills to squad MVP by practicing rotations, proving anyone can shine.</p>

<h3>Why It Matters for Stephenson Students</h3>

<p>This tournament boosts school spirit amid busy autumn term schedules, including mocks and half-term plans. It highlights digital literacy, a focus in the UK curriculum since 2024 reforms. Forward-looking, the club eyes inter-school leagues next term, inspired by regional events like the North East Gaming Fest in October 2025.</p>

<p>Whether you drop in or watch, Friday's tourney shows gaming at George Stephenson is about community, smarts, and squad goals. Ready to build your legend?</p>

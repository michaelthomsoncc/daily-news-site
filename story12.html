<p><em>With netball season starting, nutritionist visits teach quick energy boosts like banana oats—tasty and cheap. Athlete Mia, 11, loves, 'No crash like with crisps.' Trying a new snack?</em></p>

<p>Picture this: School bell rings, and you're sprinting to netball practice at George Stephenson High School. Your stomach growls—do you reach for a bag of crisps or something that keeps you going strong? As autumn chills hit Newcastle in October 2025, students like you face packed after-school schedules. But a recent school visit from nutritionist Dr. Sarah Ellis changed the game. She shared hacks to fuel your body without the mid-practice slump.</p>

<p>Netball season kicked off this week, aligning with the UK School Games push for active teens. Dr. Ellis, from the local NHS Healthy Schools programme, visited on October 15 to tackle rising teen energy dips. "Kids burn 200-300 calories in a single netball session," she explained. "The right snack prevents fatigue and boosts focus."</p>

<h3>Nutritionist Shares Science-Backed Tips</h3>

<p>Dr. Ellis drew from 2025 British Nutrition Foundation reports, which show 30% of UK teens skip healthy snacks due to cost and time. She focused on affordable options using basics from Tesco or Aldi—under £1 per serving. Key fact: Complex carbs like oats release energy slowly, unlike sugary crisps that spike and crash blood sugar. In a hands-on demo, she mixed rolled oats, mashed banana, and a splash of milk. "Prep it the night before; it's ready in seconds," she said. Bananas add potassium to fight muscle cramps, per NHS guidelines.</p>

<h3>Easy Recipe: Banana Oats Power-Up</h3>

<p>Grab a jar: Stir 40g oats, one mashed banana, 150ml milk (dairy or plant-based), and a handful of berries if you like. Refrigerate overnight. By morning, it's creamy and grab-and-go. Teens in the session tested it—most rated it 8/10 for taste. "It's like dessert but fills you up," said year 8 student Jake, 13. This hack ties into the 2025 Eat Well Guide update, emphasizing fruit for vitamins without added sugars. No oven needed, perfect for busy North East families where 40% of kids play club sports after school, according to Sport England data.</p>

<h3>Real Teens, Real Wins</h3>

<p>Mia Patel, 11, from year 7, tried it before her first netball match. "I used to munch crisps and feel wiped out by halftime," she shared. "Now with banana oats, I run faster—no crash!" Her team scored 15 more points last practice. Other students nodded; year 9's Aisha added, "It's cheap—bananas are 20p each at the market." Dr. Ellis noted similar stories from her visits to 20 Tyneside schools this term, linking better snacks to 25% improved sports performance in studies from the Journal of Adolescent Health.</p>

<p>For George Stephenson students juggling homework, sports, and mates, these hacks mean sharper focus and fun games. Netball coach Mr. Thompson plans snack stations at practices. Why not whip up banana oats tonight? Your next goal could depend on it—fuel smart, play hard this season.</p>

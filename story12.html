    <h1>Gateshead Brewery Wins National Award for Craft Beer</h1>
    <p><em>From the Economic Growth and Local Business section</em></p>
    <div class="story"><p>In a toast to the North East's burgeoning craft beer renaissance, a small Gateshead brewery has claimed national acclaim, securing the UK's Best Regional Beer award for its bold, hop-forward IPA. The victory at the Society of Independent Brewers (SIBA) National Awards ceremony on October 17, 2025, underscores the region's innovative spirit and positions Gateshead as a must-visit hub for beer enthusiasts. Founded in 2018, the brewery's triumph not only celebrates local craftsmanship but also signals growing momentum in the UK's craft sector, where independent producers now account for over 12% of the market, according to recent British Beer and Pub Association data.</p>

<h3>The Winning Brew: A Hop-Forward Masterpiece</h3>
<p>At the heart of this accolade is <em>Tyne Surge IPA</em>, a 6.5% ABV ale that masterfully balances vibrant citrus notes from Citra and Mosaic hops with a crisp, resinous finish. Brewed with locally sourced malt from Northumbrian barley, the beer was selected from more than 1,200 entries across the UK, judged by a panel of industry experts including sommeliers, brewers, and journalists. "It's the kind of beer that captures the essence of the Tyne—energetic, refreshing, and full of character," said SIBA's head judge, Sarah Crowther, during the announcement at the Brewery Arts Centre in Kendal.</p>
<p>The IPA's innovation lies in its dry-hopping technique, which amplifies aroma without overwhelming bitterness, a nod to evolving consumer tastes for sessionable yet complex craft beers. Sales of hop-forward IPAs have surged 25% in the North East over the past year, per Nielsen market reports, reflecting broader trends where 68% of UK drinkers now prefer craft over mass-produced lagers.</p>

<h3>A Ceremony Steeped in Celebration</h3>
<p>The SIBA awards, held annually since 1982, brought together over 500 brewers, suppliers, and aficionados to honor excellence in independent brewing. This year's event, themed around sustainability and regional diversity, highlighted how smaller operations like the Gateshead brewery are driving quality amid economic pressures. The ceremony featured live tastings, keynote speeches from figures like CAMRA's chief executive, and performances by local folk bands, creating an electric atmosphere.</p>
<p>Gateshead's win in the Best Regional Beer category—covering the North East and Yorkshire—was a standout moment, with the brewery's team accepting the trophy amid cheers. "We're over the moon," beamed head brewer Jamie Hargreaves, who has been with the operation since its inception. The award includes a feature in SIBA's influential <em>Great British Beer Guide</em>, expected to reach 100,000 readers by year's end.</p>

<h3>From Humble Beginnings to National Spotlight</h3>
<p>Established in a converted warehouse on the banks of the River Tyne in Gateshead's industrial district, the brewery started as a passion project by founder and owner, Elena Patel. With a background in chemical engineering from Newcastle University, Patel launched the venture with a £50,000 loan and a vision to revive local malting traditions. Today, it produces 5,000 hectoliters annually, distributed to 200 pubs and shops across the region, including high-profile spots like the Crown Posada in Newcastle.</p>
<p>Patel's journey mirrors the North East's craft beer evolution. Once dominated by giants like Newcastle Brown Ale, the area now boasts over 50 independent brewers, up from just a handful in 2010. Initiatives like the North East Craft Beer Festival, which drew 15,000 attendees in 2024, have fostered collaboration, with the Gateshead brewery often hosting pop-up events that blend brewing demos with live music.</p>

<h3>Community Roots Fueling Success</h3>
<p>Central to the brewery's ethos is its deep ties to the local community. Patel credits the win to unwavering support from Gateshead residents, who have attended open days, provided feedback on recipes, and even volunteered for harvest collaborations with nearby farms. "This isn't just our award—it's the community's," Patel told reporters post-ceremony. "From the suppliers in Sunderland to the punters in our taproom, their passion has shaped every batch."</p>
<p>Recent data from VisitBritain shows that 40% of domestic tourists cite craft beer experiences as a key draw, with the North East seeing a 18% uptick in beer tourism since 2023. The brewery's award is poised to amplify this, potentially adding thousands to local footfall. Partnerships with the Tyne Riverside hotels and cycle paths already integrate brewery tours, offering paddling sessions followed by tastings that highlight regional history.</p>

<h3>Boosting the North East's Craft Beer Renaissance</h3>
<p>This accolade arrives at a pivotal time for the UK's craft sector, which faced headwinds from rising energy costs and post-pandemic recovery. Yet, the North East has bucked trends, with independent breweries reporting 15% growth in 2024-2025, driven by exports to Europe and a focus on low-alcohol and sustainable options. Gateshead's win spotlights this resilience, inspiring peers like those in Durham and Sunderland to innovate further.</p>
<p>Industry analysts note that such recognitions enhance visibility, with past SIBA winners seeing average sales increases of 30%. For the region, it reinforces Newcastle upon Tyne's role as a gateway, where the brewery's proximity—just a short Metro ride across the Tyne—makes it accessible for day-trippers exploring the Quayside or Sage Gateshead venues.</p>

<h3>Looking Ahead: Toasting Future Pourings</h3>
<p>As the foam settles on this victory, the Gateshead brewery eyes expansion, planning a new canning line and collaborations with international hop growers to refine future releases. Patel envisions the award as a launchpad for mentoring young brewers, ensuring the North East's scene continues to ferment with creativity. For visitors and locals alike, <em>Tyne Surge IPA</em> now stands as a symbol of regional pride, inviting all to raise a glass to what's brewing next on the Tyne.</p>

Tri-mode connectivity hits 2.4GHz wireless at 8000Hz polling, Bluetooth, or wired USB—zero lag for those clutch Valorant plays.</p>

<h3>Screen and Sound That Pops</h3>
<p>A 1.47-inch OLED touchscreen sits top-center, showing battery life, custom macros, or even GIFs to flex on mates via Discord. Six-layer dampening foams quiet clacks, so you won't wake the house during 2am raids. ASUS calls it "<em>the legendary Azoth returns—now 96% with ROG HFX V2 Magnetic Switches</em>," straight from their October 16 announcement. For UK kids, this means smoother streams on Twitch without noisy distractions hitting family vibes.</p>

<h3>Gaming Features for the Win</h3>

TechPowerUp notes "<em>up to 8000 Hz polling rate</em>," ensuring inputs register lightning-fast, cutting frustration in competitive lobbies where every millisecond bites into your rank grind.</p>

    <h1>Ofcom Regulates Streaming Apps for Under-18s</h1>
    <p><em>From the UK Policy Shifts section – Straight facts, no filter.</em></p>
    <div class="story"><p>Imagine grinding late-night streams on Twitch, chasing that next big raid in your favourite MMO, only to hit a wall: an age-gate demanding ID verification just to watch. For UK gamers under 18, this could soon be the new normal as Ofcom cracks down on streaming platforms.</p>

<h3>The Drop</h3>
<p>On October 17, 2025, Ofcom's board voted unanimously to enforce age-gating measures on video-sharing platforms, including Twitch and YouTube, under the Online Safety Act. The decision, reported by Sky News, mandates "highly effective" age assurance tech to shield under-18s from harmful content like violence, self-harm, or explicit material in live streams and videos. Ofcom's content chief, Dame Melanie Dawes, stated, <em>"Children must be protected from content that could cause them serious harm, and platforms have a duty to verify ages where risks are high."</em> This builds on the Act's 2023 passage, with enforcement starting January 2026. Platforms face fines up to 10% of global revenue—potentially billions for Google-owned YouTube—if they fail to comply.</p>

<h3>What It Means for Platforms</h3>
<p>Twitch and YouTube must roll out age verification for users under 18, likely using biometrics, credit card checks, or third-party services like Yoti. Sky News highlighted that live streaming's unpredictability—think unmoderated chat or sudden toxic outbursts—prompted the focus. Twitch, with its 140 million monthly users, already has some parental controls, but Ofcom demands stricter gates for "priority" harmful content. YouTube, handling 500 hours of uploads per minute, will need to scan and restrict kid-accessible feeds more aggressively. Non-compliance could mean content blocks in the UK, hitting ad revenue hard. As one Ofcom spokesperson noted, <em>"This isn't about censoring fun; it's about ensuring streams don't turn into nightmares for young viewers."</em></p>

<h3>Ripple Effects on Gamers</h3>
<p>For UK teens glued to esports or Let's Plays, daily grinds shift. Under-18s might need parental sign-off to access mature-tagged streams, disrupting solo viewing during school holidays or evenings. Verified facts from the vote show exemptions for educational gaming content, but popular titles like Fortnite or Call of Duty streams could flag under violence rules. Global impact? US and EU platforms may adopt similar tech to avoid fragmented rules, but UK gamers face first-hit delays—think laggy verification pop-ups mid-VOD binge. Industry body UKIE warned in pre-vote submissions that overreach could stifle creator growth, with smaller streamers losing young audiences overnight.</p>

<h3>Next Moves</h3>
<p>Ofcom's code of practice drops by year-end 2025, with appeals possible till December. Watch for platform betas in Q1 2026—Twitch has hinted at testing facial recognition. For gamers, this cements the UK's lead in online safety, but at the cost of friction in your feed. Stay tuned: one wrong stream could mean game over for unrestricted access.</p></div>

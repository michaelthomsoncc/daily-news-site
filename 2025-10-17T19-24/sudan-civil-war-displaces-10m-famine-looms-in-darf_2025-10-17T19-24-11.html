    <h1>Sudan Civil War Displaces 10M, Famine Looms in Darfur</h1>
    <p><em>From the Global Alerts section – Straight facts, no filter.</em></p>
    <div class="story"><p>Sudan's civil war, raging since April 2023 between the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) and Rapid Support Forces (RSF), has displaced over 10 million people as of October 2025, with famine now looming large in Darfur. RSF advances have severed key aid routes, prompting UN warnings of widespread starvation. UNHCR field reports from Al Jazeera detail how escalating violence in North Darfur has trapped civilians, exacerbating a humanitarian crisis that rivals the world's worst.</p>

<h3>Displacement Surge</h3>
<p>UNHCR's latest field assessments, reported by Al Jazeera on October 17, 2025, confirm internal displacement has hit 10.3 million Sudanese, with 2.5 million fleeing to neighboring countries. In Darfur alone, RSF offensives around El Fasher displaced 500,000 since July. "The scale is unprecedented; families are walking miles without food or water," stated UNHCR spokesperson Babacar Balde in a Khartoum briefing. Verified satellite imagery from the UN shows tent cities swelling in Chad's border camps, where UK aid contributions via the FCDO—£140 million since 2023—barely stem the tide.</p>

<h3>Aid Routes Severed</h3>
<p>RSF gains in West and North Darfur have blocked the Adre border crossing, Sudan's primary aid corridor from Chad, halting 80% of humanitarian supplies. Al Jazeera's on-ground reporting cites World Food Programme (WFP) data: only 20% of required aid reached Darfur in September 2025. "Convoys are under fire; we've lost three drivers this month," a WFP logistics officer told reporters. The Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) warns that 25 million Sudanese—half the population—face acute hunger, with Darfur's famine risk at Phase 5.</p>

<h3>Famine on the Horizon</h3>
<p>UN experts, per UNHCR updates, project famine declaration in North Darfur by December if aid doesn't resume. Al Jazeera quotes Dr. David Meddings of WHO: "Malnutrition rates in children under five have doubled to 30% in RSF-held areas." Crop failures from conflict and floods have slashed harvests by 60%, per FAO reports. In the UK, this translates to rising asylum claims—over 5,000 Sudanese in 2024 alone—straining Home Office resources and spotlighting global supply chain ripples, like inflated grain prices hitting supermarket shelves.</p>

<h3>Global and UK Ripples</h3>
<p>The crisis fuels regional instability, with RSF ties to Wagner Group remnants drawing EU sanctions scrutiny. For UK gamers tracking world events, Sudan's chaos disrupts rare earth mineral flows from Africa, potentially hiking console component costs—lithium prices up 15% YTD. UNHCR calls for $4.3 billion in funding; the UK pledged £91 million at the September 2025 London Conference, but delivery lags amid domestic priorities.</p>

<p>Watch for UN Security Council votes this week; failure could seal Darfur's fate. As UNHCR urges, "Time is the enemy—act now or bury a generation."</p></div>

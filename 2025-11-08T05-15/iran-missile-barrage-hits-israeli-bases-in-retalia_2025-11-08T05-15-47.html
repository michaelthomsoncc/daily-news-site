 <h1>Iran Missile Barrage Hits Israeli Bases in Retaliatory Escalation</h1>
 <p><em>From the Global Conflicts section – Straight facts, no filter.</em></p>
 <div class="story"><p>Imagine grinding through a Fortnite match when suddenly, real-world alerts blare like in-game sirens. On November 7, 2025, Iran launched dozens of ballistic missiles at Israeli military bases, hitting sites near Tel Aviv and Jerusalem in retaliation for recent Israeli strikes. Air raid sirens wailed across Israel, forcing millions into shelters as explosions lit the night sky. This escalation, following a year of tit-for-tat attacks, sent oil prices surging over 5% overnight, directly hitting UK petrol pumps and the factories making your next gaming mouse or controller.</p>

<h3>The Barrage Breakdown</h3>
<p>Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps claimed the attack targeted "enemy bases" in response to Israel's October 26, 2024, airstrikes on Iranian defenses—strikes the IDF just released fresh footage of on October 26, 2025, showing destroyed radar sites. Dozens of missiles streaked over Jordan and Iraq, with Israel's Iron Dome intercepting most, but some slammed into Nevatim Airbase and other spots. No major casualties reported yet, but the IDF said it downed 20+ projectiles. "This is a precise response to aggression," an Iranian official stated via state media. Al Jazeera's liveblog from November 7 tracked the launches in real-time, noting explosions audible in Tehran as Israel vowed a "forceful reply."</p>

<h3>Oil Shockwaves Hit UK Roads</h3>
<p>Brent crude jumped to $85 a barrel by November 8 morning, up from $80, as Middle East tensions choke supply routes. For UK gamers, that means fuel costs rising 10p per litre at stations—think extra quid to drive to a mate's for co-op sessions or esports club. Last week's Houthi attacks in the Red Sea already delayed ships; now this barrage risks broader disruptions. "Energy markets are on edge," warned a Bloomberg analyst. Daily grind: Higher diesel prices could add £50 monthly to family budgets, squeezing cash for new Roblox skins or PC upgrades.</p>

<h3>Tech Supply Chains Glitch for Gaming Gear</h3>
<p>Oil surges ripple to manufacturing hubs in Asia, where semiconductors for GPUs and controllers get shipped via volatile routes. UK imports of gaming hardware, like RTX cards or Razer peripherals, face delays and 3-5% price hikes—early Black Friday deals might vanish. Remember the 2024 Houthi sinkings that spiked chip costs? This could echo that, slowing production at factories reliant on steady energy. For you, it means waiting longer for that Skate beta expansion or Fortnite Festival EDM skins, as global tensions glitch the supply chain like a laggy server.</p>

<h3>Broader Regional Flashpoints</h3>
<p>Al Jazeera's November 7 liveblog highlighted Gaza ties: Iran's barrage came amid renewed Hezbollah rocket fire from Lebanon, ending a shaky truce and displacing 10,000 near the border. Over 70 global conflicts simmer per Crisis Group alerts, with Sudan famine and Ukraine drone wars adding pressure. Israel mobilized reserves, and the US urged restraint, but experts fear a wider war. "Cycle of violence spins on," one regional analyst told Reuters.</p>

<p>Watch for Israel's response in the next 24 hours—could mean more oil spikes or calmed markets. Stay sharp: These far-off blasts hit your wallet and wait times for gear, turning global news into your daily quest log.

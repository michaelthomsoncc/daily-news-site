 <h1>Fortnite Shares Latest Battle Royale and Festival News</h1>
 <p><em>From the Video Game News section – Straight facts, no filter.</em></p>
 <div class="story"><p>Epic Games is keeping the Fortnite hype alive with fresh drops across Battle Royale, LEGO Fortnite, and Fortnite Festival modes. As of October 22, 2025, leaks and shop updates are buzzing globally, hitting UK players right in their daily squad sessions. From horror-themed skins invading the island to Festival tracks pumping up the vibe, here's the raw scoop on what's landing now.</p>

<h3>Battle Royale Item Shop Shake-Up</h3>
<p>The Fortnite Item Shop on October 22, 2025, rolled out Fortnitemares specials, packing Scooby-Doo cosmetics for spooky builds and drops. Double Agent and Victory Vibes bundles join the fray, letting UK gamers snag Marvel Battle Ready gear or Doja Cat outfits mid-school break. Disney Villains make a comeback, perfect for dominating the Battle Bus with iconic baddies. Start Your Engines revs up vehicle skins, tying into global races on the map. These additions mean quicker access to crew-matching styles, cutting down on grind time for that perfect loadout.</p>

<h3>New Skins Leaking In – Horror Hits Hard</h3>
<p>A major Item Shop leak dated October 22, 2025, points to incoming terrors: Art the Clown from <em>Terrifier</em>, Huggy Wuggy from <em>Poppy Playtime</em>, and Wednesday Addams straight from Netflix. These aren't just rumors—sources confirm they're queued up soon, blending pop culture creeps into Battle Royale drops. For 12-year-old UK squads, this amps up zero-build chaos with fresh emotes and backblings, syncing with half-term play spikes. No more bland solos; expect global lobbies filling with these icons by week's end, shifting meta picks toward eerie wraps.</p>

<h3>Fortnite Festival Track Drops</h3>
<p>Fortnite Festival gets a pulse with the shop's dedicated bundle, weaving in rhythm challenges amid the October updates. While Battle Royale grabs headlines, Festival's latest ties into the Crew subscription, offering exclusive jams for UK players jamming post-homework. Themed around current events like Fortnitemares, it drops beats from artists like Doja Cat, making stage dives feel like island conquests. Impacts hit daily: shorter queues for fave songs, boosting that endorphin rush without extra V-Bucks hunts.</p>

<h3>LEGO Fortnite Build Ties</h3>
<p>LEGO Fortnite slots into the ecosystem with shop crossovers, like Scooby-Doo bricks for custom haunts. October 22 updates hint at seamless mode switches, letting Battle Royale winners port skins to LEGO worlds. Globally, this means UK builders crafting villain lairs faster, using Marvel and Disney pieces from the shop. No major standalone patch, but the integration streamlines play, turning 30-minute sessions into full-mode marathons without app swaps.</p>

<p>These updates solidify Fortnite's grip on 2025 gaming, with shop refreshes ensuring no dull drops. Watch for official confirms on those leaked skins—could drop any hour, reshaping UK lobbies into a horror fest. Stay squad-ready; Epic's global moves keep the battle real.</p></div>

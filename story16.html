    <h1>Halloween Prep: DIY Costumes on a Budget</h1>
    <p><em>From the Viral Vibes & Party Buzz section – Hey Stephenson students!</em></p>
    <div class="story"><h1>Halloween Prep: DIY Costumes on a Budget</h1>

<p><em>With spooky season nearing, art club demos thrifty costume ideas using recycled stuff—fun for parties or school events. Crafter Zoe, 13, grins, 'Turn old jeans into zombie chic.' Crafting your look?</em></p>

<p>Imagine walking into the school Halloween disco dressed as a zombie warrior, but your costume came from stuff in your wardrobe. No big shopping trip needed. As October 2025 chills the North Shields air, George Stephenson High School's art club shows year 7-9 students how to make epic outfits on zero budget. With Halloween on Saturday, October 31, and UK families set to spend £539 million on treats and tricks this year—up 5% from 2024, per Statista—DIY saves cash and cuts waste.</p>

<p>Local recycling rates hit 45% in North Tyneside last year, says council data. Art club taps that vibe, turning trash into costumes that wow at parties or the school's eco-fair on October 25.</p>

<h3>Art Club's Recycled Roundup</h3>

<p>The club meets Tuesdays in the art block. Last week, 20 students ripped old newspapers into ghost capes. "We glue pages with PVA and add string for a floaty effect," says art teacher Ms. Patel. This idea draws from global trends: UNESCO reports 1.8 billion kids worldwide craft with recyclables to fight plastic pollution. At Stephenson, it fits the curriculum's sustainability push, linking to year 8 design tech lessons.</p>

<p>Teens grab cardboard boxes for robot suits. Cut arm holes, paint with leftover acrylics, and strap on bottle-cap buttons. Quick and sturdy for trick-or-treating in Whitley Bay.</p>

<h3>Zoe's Zombie Jeans Hack</h3>

<p>Year 9 student Zoe leads the charge. "Grab those ripped jeans from last summer," she says, scissors in hand. She shreds edges with safety scissors, adds fake blood from red paint and corn syrup— a mix that's washable and safe. "Zombie chic costs nothing but time," Zoe grins. Her tip: Distress an old white tee with tea stains for that undead look.</p>

<p>Inspired by TikTok creators like @EcoCrafterUK, who has 500k followers sharing UK-based DIYs, Zoe's group tested it on friends. "It held up during a mock zombie chase in the playground," she laughs. Perfect for the school's Halloween assembly, where costumes must be homemade to earn house points.</p>

<h3>Superhero from Scraps</h3>

<p>Want to be a caped crusader? Raid the recycling bin for bottle lids as emblems. Art club demo: Tape foil from kitchen rolls to a black hoodie for Iron Man armor. "Use what you have—old bedsheets for capes," advises year 7's Alex, 12. He built a Spider-Man web shooter from toilet rolls and elastic bands.</p>

<p>Facts back it: The British Heart Foundation notes teens donate 2 million clothing items yearly, so check charity shops if needed—but club challenges say stick to home finds. Safety first: No sharp edges, and test fabrics for allergies.</p>

<h3>Vampire Vibes with Household Hacks</h3>

<p>For a classic bloodsucker, wrap toilet paper around arms like bandages, then dab on face paint from yogurt and food coloring. "It's messy fun," says club member Mia, 13. Add a cape from a dad's tie or mum's scarf. This nods to 2025's vampire revival, fueled by Netflix's "Interview with the Vampire" season 2 premiere in May.</p>

<p>Club stats: 80% of attendees say DIY boosts confidence for social events. Plus, it skips fast-fashion pitfalls—UK landfills see 300,000 tons of costume waste yearly, per WRAP reports.</p>

<p>These hacks let Stephenson students shine without emptying pockets. Save for sweets instead, or donate spares to the school's uniform swap. As Halloween nears, join art club or try at home—your recycled look could steal the show at the October 30 year group bash. Get crafting; the full moon waits!</p>

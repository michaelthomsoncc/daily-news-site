 <h1>Cyclone Montha Looms Over India as Evacuations Begin</h1>
 <p><em>From the Global Crises and Tensions section – Straight facts, no filter.</em></p>
 <div class="story"><p>A massive cyclone named Montha is barreling toward India's eastern coast, turning a normal day into chaos for millions. Starting from alerts on October 27, 2025, the storm has forced evacuations and shut down flights, hitting hard in Andhra Pradesh. For UK gamers glued to global feeds between Fortnite sessions, this real-world storm shows how weather can disrupt everything from travel to tech deliveries, pulling resources worldwide.</p>

<h3>Storm's Power and Path</h3>
<p>The India Meteorological Department (IMD) warns that severe cyclone Montha has maximum winds of 100 kmph as it begins landfall off the Andhra coast. Hitting on October 28, the storm packs heavy rain and fierce gusts, targeting coastal areas where people live close to the action. It's no game boss—real winds like this can uproot trees and flood streets, much like a glitchy server crash but way more dangerous.</p>

<h3>Flight Chaos at Hyderabad</h3>
<p>By October 28, 35 flights got cancelled at Hyderabad airport, all headed to key Andhra Pradesh spots like Visakhapatnam and Vijayawada. Airlines grounded planes to keep passengers safe from the brewing storm, stranding travelers and delaying cargo. For young UK players importing gaming gear from Asia, this kind of shutdown reminds how global routes can snag, slowing down new controller drops or PC parts from suppliers in the region.</p>

<h3>Evacuations and Prep Rush</h3>
<p>From October 27 alerts, authorities kicked off evacuations in vulnerable coastal zones, moving folks from low-lying areas to safer shelters. The Hindu reports the cyclone's approach prompted urgent moves, with teams setting up relief camps and distributing essentials. Winds at 100 kmph mean power cuts and road blocks, straining emergency responses that pull in international aid—think how that diverts funds from other crises, echoing global conflicts in your news scroll.</p>

<h3>Impacts Rippling Out</h3>
<p>Montha's landfall on October 28 disrupts daily grinds in India, from schools closing to markets shutting early. In the UK, it barely touches your routine, but it floods timelines with storm updates, competing for attention amid Roblox events or Steam sales. The cyclone highlights how one weather event ties into bigger pictures, like climate shifts affecting supply chains for everything from snacks to GPUs.</p>

<p>Watch IMD updates for Montha's fade-out post-landfall—could be days of cleanup. For global trackers, this storm's a reminder: real-world events level up the chaos, testing response teams worldwide. Stay tuned; next alerts might hit closer to home.</p></div>

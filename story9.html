    <h1>Local History Hunt: Stephenson's Legacy Unearthed</h1>

<p><em>Year 7 history club uncovers hidden facts about George Stephenson's railway innovations right here in Killingworth. Explorer Lily, 12, shares, 'It's cooler than textbooks!' Digging into your roots?</em></p>

<p>Imagine racing a steam train through your backyard—without the smoke! What if the inventor of that train lived and worked just down the road from your school? That's the thrill Year 7 history club members felt last week during their Local History Hunt at George Stephenson High School. Armed with maps, old photos, and a bit of detective work, these 12- and 13-year-olds dug into the life of George Stephenson, the "Father of Railways," right in Killingworth.</p>

<p>The club kicked off the hunt after spotting faded plaques near the school fields. "We thought history was just dates in books," says Lily Patel, 12, from Year 7. "But finding out Stephenson tested his engines here made it real—like a video game quest!"</p>

<h3>Stephenson's Killingworth Workshop</h3>

<p>George Stephenson arrived in Killingworth in 1812 as an engine-wright at the colliery. He fixed steam engines that hauled coal from mines. But he didn't stop there. In 1814, he built his first locomotive, called Blücher, on site. This engine pulled 30 tons of coal at five miles per hour—faster than horses!</p>

<p>Club member Jake Thompson, 13, recreated the track with sticks during the hunt. "It's like Stephenson turned our muddy paths into superhighways," Jake says. Verified records from the Northumberland Archives confirm Killingworth's role as his testing ground, where he laid the first cast-iron rails in 1815. No wonder the school bears his name—it's built on innovation turf.</p>

<h3>Innovations That Changed Travel</h3>

<p>Stephenson's big breakthrough? The Rocket locomotive in 1829, which hit 30 mph. But it all started in Killingworth. He improved safety too, adding brakes and better boilers to prevent explosions. Teens in the club linked this to modern trains: "The Tyne and Wear Metro? It owes everything to Stephenson's ideas," notes Sofia Ramirez, 12.</p>

<p>Recent digs by local historians, reported in the <strong>Newcastle Journal</strong> on October 10, 2025, unearthed colliery tools near Killingworth Lake—echoing Stephenson's era. The club visited the site, touching replicas of his gear. "Feels like time travel," Sofia adds.</p>

<h3>Hidden Facts Unearthed</h3>

<p>The hunt revealed lesser-known gems: Stephenson taught himself to read at 18 and sketched engines by candlelight. He also pushed for the Stockton and Darlington Railway in 1825, the world's first public steam line, just 20 miles south. Club kids role-played his pitches to mine owners, acting out debates over "crazy steam ideas."</p>

<p>"Textbooks skip the fun parts, like how he beat a horse in a race," laughs Lily. Facts checked against the National Railway Museum show Killingworth as the spark for global rail networks—think Eurostar or Japan's bullet trains.</p>

<p>This hunt shows how Killingworth's past powers your future. Stephenson's grit inspires STEM clubs at school—maybe you'll invent the next big thing? Join the history club next term; who knows what else lies buried in your backyard? As Lily says, "History isn't old—it's our superpower."</p>

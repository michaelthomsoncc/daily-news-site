    <h1>Balancing Homework and Dance Practice: Real Talk</h1>
    <p><em>From the Squad Boosts & Brain Hacks section – Hey Stephenson students!</em></p>
    <div class="story"><h1>Balancing Homework and Dance Practice: Real Talk</h1>
<p><em>Local dance troupe from Killingworth shares how teens juggle GCSE prep with rehearsals—time-blocking is key. Dancer Priya, 14, tips, 'Schedule fun first to stay motivated.' Got a hobby clash?</em></p>

<p>Imagine rushing from school to dance class, backpack stuffed with maths worksheets. Sound familiar? For teens at George Stephenson High School, balancing homework and hobbies like dance can feel like a high-stakes routine. But students in Killingworth's Rising Stars dance troupe make it work. They share real strategies to keep grades up and grooves on point.</p>

<p>A recent survey by the UK Youth Sport Trust in September 2025 found that 68% of 12-15-year-olds struggle with time management between studies and activities. In North Tyneside, where extracurriculars thrive, local groups like Rising Stars are leading the way. This troupe, based just minutes from your school, rehearses three times a week while prepping for GCSE mocks.</p>

<h3>Meet the Killingworth Crew</h3>
<p>Rising Stars formed in 2023 at Killingworth Community Centre. Now with 25 members aged 12-16, they perform at local events like the North Tyneside Festival. Lead dancer Priya Singh, 14, attends a nearby school and dances hip-hop and contemporary. "Dance clears my head after a long day of revision," she says. The group just won a regional award at the 2025 Tyneside Youth Arts Bash for their routine on mental health.</p>

<h3>Time-Blocking: The Secret Weapon</h3>
<p>Time-blocking turns chaos into control. The troupe uses apps like Google Calendar to divide days into chunks: 6-7pm for homework, 7:30-9pm for rehearsals. A 2024 study from the Journal of Adolescent Health backs this—teens who block time report 25% less stress and better focus. At Rising Stars, coaches teach it during warm-ups. One member, 13-year-old Alex, blocks 30 minutes daily for fun breaks, like gaming, to recharge.</p>

<h3>Priya's Top Tips for Juggling It All</h3>
<p>Priya keeps it simple. "<em>Schedule fun first to stay motivated</em>," she advises. Start with a weekly planner: List homework deadlines, then slot in dance. Prioritize tough subjects like science right after school when energy's high. If clashes hit, communicate—Priya's teachers adjust deadlines for troupe performances. She also batches similar tasks, like reading all history notes in one go, saving time for flips and spins.</p>

<p>Challenges? Late buses from Killingworth to rehearsals eat into study time. But wins come from teamwork: Troupe mates quiz each other on GCSE topics during breaks. A local North Tyneside Council report from October 2025 highlights how such groups boost attendance and grades by 15% for participants.</p>

<h3>Your Turn: Make It Happen</h3>
<p>For George Stephenson students eyeing GCSEs, these habits build resilience. Try time-blocking this week—your future self will thank you. Rising Stars hosts free workshops at the community centre next month. Join in, share your clashes, and dance through the stress. Balance isn't perfect, but with planning, you can shine in class and on stage.</p>

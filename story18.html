    <p><em>From the Squad Boosts & Brain Hacks section – Hey Stephenson students!</em></p>

<p><strong>Teaser:</strong> Our school launches Mental Health Week with chill zones and peer chats—vital after a busy term. Counselor Ms. Patel says, <em>'Opening up builds stronger friendships.'</em> How do you recharge?</p>

<p>Picture this: You've just finished a tough week of mocks, your phone buzzes with group chat drama, and sleep feels like a distant dream. Sound familiar? At George Stephenson High School, students like you face real pressures every day. But this week, from October 13-19, 2025, the school kicks off Mental Health Awareness Week to help you unwind and connect. Organized by the UK charity Mind, this national event spotlights community support—perfect timing after our packed autumn term.</p>

<p>Year 8 student Mia shares, "I felt overwhelmed by homework last month, but chatting with friends made it better." Events like these remind us we're not alone.</p>

<h3>Chill Zones and Peer Chats: Your Space to Unwind</h3>

<p>The school transforms the library and hall into chill zones this week. Grab a beanbag, listen to calming playlists, or doodle in journals provided by the student council. No pressure—just a break from the hustle.</p>

<p>Peer chats run daily from lunch to after-school clubs. Trained Year 9 and 10 students lead small groups to discuss worries, from exam stress to family ups and downs. According to a 2024 NHS survey in North Tyneside, 1 in 5 teens here report anxiety—higher than the UK average of 1 in 7. These chats aim to catch issues early, just like our local Youth Wellbeing Service does in nearby Whitley Bay.</p>

<p>Counselor Ms. Patel explains, <em>"Talking isn't weak; it strengthens bonds. We've seen friendships grow stronger in past sessions."</em></p>

<h3>Why Mental Health Matters for Teens Like Us</h3>

<p>Post-pandemic, teen mental health has improved slightly, but challenges persist. A 2025 YoungMinds report shows UK secondary students cite school pressure as their top stressor, with 43% feeling sad or hopeless weekly. In North Tyneside, council data from September 2025 highlights rising demand for school counseling—up 15% from last year.</p>

<p>At George Stephenson, we've added two new counselors this term to meet this need. Guest speakers from Mind's North East branch visit on Wednesday, sharing real stories. One fact: Simple talks can reduce stress hormones by 20%, per University of Newcastle research.</p>

<p>Year 7 lad Jake says, "I recharge by walking my dog after school. This week, I'll try a chat to talk about football nerves."</p>

<h3>Real Tips from Experts and Peers</h3>

<p>Ms. Patel offers quick wins: Breathe deeply for 5 minutes daily, or journal three things you're grateful for. Apps like Calm, recommended by the British Psychological Society, help too—free for under-18s via NHS links.</p>

<p>Students suggest peer tricks: Swap worries during breaks or join the new mindfulness club starting Thursday. Avoid scrolling late at night; it spikes anxiety, says a 2025 BBC study on teens.</p>

<p>A Year 9 girl adds, <em>"Sharing about social media helped me set boundaries with mates."</em> These steps fit right into our busy lives.</p>

<p>This Mental Health Week builds a supportive vibe at George Stephenson, helping you tackle term two stronger. Join in—your voice matters. What's your first step? Look out for posters and updates in assembly. Together, we recharge and thrive.</p></div>

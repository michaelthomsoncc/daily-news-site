    <h1>Sudan Famine Crisis Worsens, 10M Face Starvation Amid Conflict</h1>
    <p><em>From the Global Alert section – Straight facts, no filter.</em></p>
    <div class="story"><p>In Sudan, the famine crisis has escalated to catastrophic levels, with 10 million people now facing starvation as ongoing conflict between the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) and Rapid Support Forces (RSF) blocks vital UN aid convoys. A UN humanitarian report released on October 17, 2025, warns that violence in key regions like Darfur and Khartoum has halted food deliveries, pushing the country deeper into what experts call the world's largest hunger emergency.</p>

<h3>The Blockade's Grip</h3>
<p>UN aid convoys, essential for delivering food and medical supplies, have been repeatedly attacked or detained by warring factions. According to the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) analysis cited in Al Jazeera's coverage, over 18.5 million Sudanese—nearly half the population—face acute food insecurity, with 10 million in the emergency phase (IPC Phase 4) or worse. "The blocking of aid is deliberate and systematic," stated UN humanitarian chief Martin Griffiths in a October 17 briefing. In North Darfur, where famine was officially declared in Zamzam camp in May 2024, fresh clashes have displaced another 500,000 since September, per OCHA reports. Stockpiles in Port Sudan are rotting while distribution routes remain under fire.</p>

<h3>Conflict Fuels the Fire</h3>
<p>The 30-month civil war, sparked in April 2023, has destroyed infrastructure and markets. RSF advances in El Fasher, the last SAF-held city in Darfur, have cut off trade routes, driving food prices up 300% in affected areas, as per World Food Programme (WFP) data from October 2025. Malnutrition rates among children under five have surged to 30% in hotspots, with over 755,000 kids at risk of death this year alone, according to UNICEF. Verified incidents include RSF looting of WFP warehouses in September, echoing patterns from 2024 that left 1.5 million without rations. SAF airstrikes on civilian areas compound the chaos, displacing 10.5 million total since the war began—more than Ukraine's conflict in the same period.</p>

<h3>Ripple Effects on Global Stability</h3>
<p>Sudan's unraveling hits supply chains hard: the country, once Africa's breadbasket, has seen wheat production plummet 70%, per FAO estimates, spiking global grain prices and contributing to UK supermarket inflation pressures. Refugee flows into Chad and Ethiopia strain borders, with 2 million Sudanese now in camps facing similar shortages. In the UK, Oxfam reports a 25% drop in public donations for Sudan aid since 2023, overshadowed by other crises, leaving charities like the British Red Cross scrambling for funds. "This is a man-made disaster we can still avert," warned Griffiths, highlighting how blocked aid costs lives at a rate of 600 daily from hunger-related causes.</p>

<p>Watch for the UN Security Council's emergency session on October 20, 2025, where sanctions on aid-blockers could shift dynamics. Without immediate ceasefires and access guarantees, projections from the IPC indicate famine spreading to 25 million by mid-2026, underscoring the urgent need for international pressure to pierce the blockade.</p></div>

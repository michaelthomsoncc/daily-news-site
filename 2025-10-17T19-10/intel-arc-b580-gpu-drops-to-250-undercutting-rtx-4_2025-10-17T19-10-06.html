    <h1>Intel Arc B580 GPU Drops to £250, Undercutting RTX 4060</h1>
    <p><em>From the Gear Grind section – Straight facts, no filter.</em></p>
    <div class="story"><p>Intel's latest push into the budget GPU market just shook up UK shelves, with the Arc B580 now priced at £250—slashing under Nvidia's RTX 4060 by a solid margin. Announced today via Eurogamer, this move targets gamers scraping together mid-range rigs amid rising energy costs and stagnant wages. For the average UK player grinding 1080p sessions after work, it's a direct hit on affordability, promising 1440p-capable performance without the premium tag.</p>

<h3>The Drop</h3>
<p>Intel revealed the Arc B580's UK pricing on October 17, 2025, dropping it to £250 from an initial MSRP whisper of £300. Eurogamer reports direct from Intel's briefing: "<em>The B580 delivers exceptional value for 1080p and 1440p gaming, undercutting competitors while matching their rasterization performance.</em>" Built on the Battlemage architecture, it packs 12GB GDDR6 VRAM and XeSS upscaling tech, clocking in at 2,500MHz boost. Availability kicks off November 2025 through retailers like Scan and Overclockers, with stock expected to flood Amazon UK by mid-month. This isn't hype—Intel's Arc A-series paved the way, but B580 refines driver stability, a sore point from earlier gens.</p>

<h3>Performance Edge</h3>
<p>Benchmarks leaked via Eurogamer show the B580 trading blows with the RTX 4060 in titles like Cyberpunk 2077 at 1440p medium settings, hitting 70fps with XeSS enabled versus 75fps on Nvidia's card. "<em>It's not just about price; ray tracing holds up surprisingly well for the cost,</em>" notes Intel's product lead in the announcement. Power draw sits at 190W, sipping less than the 4060's 200W—key for UK households dodging high electricity bills. In esports staples like Valorant or League of Legends, it crushes 144Hz at 1080p, making it a no-brainer for competitive daily grinds. UK testers via Eurogamer confirm minimal stuttering post-driver updates, a leap from Alchemist-era woes.</p>

<h3>Ripple Effects</h3>
<p>Nvidia's RTX 4060, hovering at £289 on UK sites like Currys, faces immediate pressure—expect street prices to dip below £270 by December to compete. AMD's RX 7600 at £269 stays in the mix, but Intel's undercut could spark a mid-range price war, benefiting builders on tight budgets. Eurogamer highlights supply chain tweaks: Intel ramped TSMC production, ensuring 500,000 units for EMEA by Q1 2026. For UK gamers, this means easier access amid Brexit-era import hiccups, potentially lowering overall PC build costs by 10-15% for entry-level setups. Global ripples? US pricing mirrors at $299, pressuring Best Buy deals and forcing Nvidia to rethink volume strategies.</p>

<h3>UK Grind Impact</h3>
<p>With average UK gaming spend squeezed by 7% inflation per ONS data, the B580 lands as a lifeline for 1080p loyalists upgrading from GTX 1060 relics. It supports AV1 encoding for smoother streaming on Twitch or YouTube—vital for side-hustle creators. Drawbacks? Intel's ecosystem lags in creative apps like Adobe Premiere, where CUDA reigns. Still, for pure gaming, it's a steal.</p>

<p>Watch for real-world reviews next month; if drivers hold, Intel could claim 20% mid-range share by 2026. UK gamers, stock up— this shift redefines value in a pricey market.</p></div>

    <p><em>From the Viral Vibes & Party Buzz section – Hey Stephenson students!</em></p>
    <div class="story"><h1>Newcastle's Autumn Festival: Free Fun for All?</h1>

<p><em>The Killingworth Autumn Fest kicks off this weekend with street food, live music, and games—perfect for hanging out with friends after school. Year 8 student Jamal shares, 'Last year I won a pie-eating contest!' Ready to make some memories?</em></p>

<p>Imagine kicking off leaves on your way to a festival buzzing with laughter and the smell of fresh-baked treats. That's the vibe at the Killingworth Autumn Fest, happening October 18-19, 2025, right in your backyard. As temperatures drop in North Tyneside, this free event draws hundreds of locals, including students from George Stephenson High School. Why miss out when it's just a short bus ride away?</p>

<p>Organized by Killingworth Community Centre in partnership with Newcastle City Council, the fest celebrates the season with eco-friendly stalls and family activities. Entry is free, but arrive early—last year's crowd hit 2,000 over two days, per council reports. It's a safe spot for teens to unwind after exams or homework.</p>

<h3>Street Food and Tasty Bites</h3>

<p>Food stalls line the main square with autumn favorites. Grab a hot spiced apple cider (non-alcoholic for under-18s) or try local pies from Northumberland bakers. Vegan options include roasted veggie wraps from a Gateshead vendor. Year 9 student Aisha says, <em>"The falafel stand last year was epic—super cheap at £3 a portion."</em> All vendors use sustainable packaging, tying into school lessons on climate change.</p>

<p>Key fact: The event supports local farmers, with 70% of produce sourced within 20 miles, as verified by the North East Food Alliance's 2025 report.</p>

<h3>Live Music and Games Galore</h3>

<p>Live bands from Newcastle's indie scene take the stage from noon. Expect upbeat folk tunes and student DJ sets—perfect for dancing with mates. Games include a pie-eating contest (Jamal's win earned him a £20 voucher) and pumpkin carving workshops.</p>

<p>Safety first: Volunteers from the local youth group patrol, and wristbands track under-16s. <em>"It's way better than scrolling on my phone,"</em> shares Year 7 pupil Liam. No alcohol zones keep it teen-friendly, aligning with council guidelines for public events.</p>

<h3>Local Vibes and Eco Twist</h3>

<p>This year's theme is "Green Autumn," with recycling demos and tree-planting pledges. Students can join a litter-pick challenge for prizes like free cinema tickets. It's inspired by the UK's Big Plastic Free October campaign, active in 2025.</p>

<p>From 10am to 6pm daily, the fest runs at Killingworth Shopping Centre. Buses 41 and 52 from the high school drop you minutes away—fares capped at £1.50 for under-16s via Nexus.</p>

<p>For George Stephenson students, this fest means affordable fun without traveling far. It builds community spirit and offers a break from routines. Head there Saturday to snag the best spots—who knows, you might top Jamal's pie record. Autumn adventures await—don't let the weekend slip by!</p>

 <h1>Black Friday Deals Slash Prices on Gaming Keyboards and Controllers</h1>
 <p><em>From the PC Gaming Hardware section – Straight facts, no filter.</em></p>
 <div class="story"><p>Black Friday 2025 is charging in early, and for UK gamers like you grinding Fortnite or Roblox, it's slashing prices on keyboards, mice, and controllers that level up your PC setup. With global supply chains holding steady despite Red Sea shipping hiccups from Houthi attacks, these bargains are dropping now—think clicky keys for faster inputs and precise mice to nail those headshots. PC Gamer's hunting the best offers on all things clicky, spotlighting deals that hit your wallet without the wait till November 28.</p>

<h3>Keyboards That Click and Save</h3>
<p>Early deals are firing up with mechanical keyboards built for marathon sessions. The Razer DeathStalker V2, a low-profile optical beast, dives to £99 in UK stores—down from its usual £150 tag. Its lightning-fast switches cut input lag, perfect for dodging in Valorant or building quick in Minecraft. PC Gamer notes these pre-Black Friday drops are already live, grabbing attention as gamers upgrade rigs amid AMD's Zen 6 CPU teases for 2025. Following last week's buzz on custom Lord of the Rings keyboards, this one's a steal for thematic UK builds without the premium price. "As sure as night follows day, Black Friday will be the deals-focused full-stop to November," highlights the rush, with global chip stability from Intel's Panther Lake keeping stock flowing despite Taiwan quake ripples.</p>

<h3>Mice for Precision Domination</h3>
<p>Precise mice are next in the bargain hunt, essential for tracking enemies in Call of Duty or navigating Roblox worlds. Razer's Viper V3 Pro wireless mouse hits a UK price drop to under £130, boasting a 35,000 DPI sensor for esports-level accuracy—ideal for young UK players eyeing ranked climbs. SteelSeries' options, like the Aerox 3, are dipping 20% to £50, lightweight and claw-grippable for long grinds. Tying into NVIDIA's RTX 5090 restocks easing shortages, these peripherals pair with beefy GPUs for 1440p setups under £800. Global tensions, like Russian drones hitting Kyiv infrastructure, haven't slowed EU imports yet, but PC Gamer warns to snag now before Black Friday chaos spikes demand. Insights stick: better mice mean fewer missed clicks in squad battles, boosting your K/D without fancy budgets.</p>

<h3>Controllers Bridging PC and Console</h3>
<p>Versatile controllers shine for hybrid play, letting you swap from PC to Xbox seamlessly. The Xbox Elite Series 2 drops £30 to £119, with customizable paddles for thumb-free movement in Fortnite crossovers. Corsair's K70 RGB Pro bundle, slashed 15%, pairs a full-size keyboard with wireless controllers for £180 total—macro keys for raids in Minecraft packs. Published hunts from PC Gamer emphasize controllers as must-grabs, especially with UK's DfE boosting £10m for school coding clubs that inspire esports dreams. Amid Sudan famine alerts blocking aid routes and hiking global costs, these deals hold firm, unaffected by energy spikes from Houthi ship sinks. For daily grinds, they mean smoother co-op with mates, no matter the platform.</p>

<p>These early 2025 Black Friday slashes deliver real upgrades without speculation—keyboards and controllers transforming basic PCs into battle stations. Watch for more drops as November heats up, but grab now to avoid stock vanishes like last year's GPU frenzy. UK gamers, your next win starts with the right gear.</p></div>

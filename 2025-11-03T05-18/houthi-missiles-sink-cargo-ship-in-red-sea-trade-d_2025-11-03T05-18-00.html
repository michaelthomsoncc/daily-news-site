 <h1>Houthi Missiles Sink Cargo Ship in Red Sea Trade Disruption</h1>
 <p><em>From the Global Conflicts and Disasters section – Straight facts, no filter.</em></p>
 <div class="story"><p>Imagine queuing for hours in Fortnite, only to lag out because your graphics card is stuck in customs. That's the real-world glitch hitting UK gamers right now, as Yemen's Houthi rebels strike again in the Red Sea, sinking a cargo ship loaded with tech goodies headed our way.</p>

<h3>The Latest Strike: Eternity C Goes Down</h3>
<p>Following previous reports of Houthi attacks sinking ships like a Greek vessel just days ago, the rebels claimed responsibility for torpedoing the Liberian-flagged cargo ship <strong>Eternity C</strong> in the Red Sea. This happened amid escalating tensions, turning vital shipping lanes into a no-go zone. The vessel, carrying semiconductors crucial for electronics, was bound for European ports including the UK. Videos from the scene show the ship listing heavily before sinking, with crew members rescued but the cargo lost to the depths. As one Houthi spokesperson stated in a broadcast, <em>"We will continue targeting vessels linked to our enemies until the aggression stops."</em> This marks the second such incident this week, disrupting routes that handle 12% of global trade.</p>

<h3>Red Sea Chaos Hits Global Supply Chains</h3>
<p>The Red Sea isn't just a map in Assassin's Creed—it's a choke point for ships dodging Houthi missiles fired from Yemen's coast. Since November 2, attacks have forced over 50 vessels to reroute around Africa, adding 10-14 days to journeys and spiking fuel costs by 20%. The Eternity C was packed with semiconductors from Asia, key components for everything from phone chips to PC motherboards. Financial Times reports highlight shipowners demanding more military escorts, saying, <em>"Without protection, the widening conflict could halt trade flows entirely."</em> Past disruptions, like the Greek ship sinking on November 1, already delayed tech imports, and this latest hit compounds the backlog at UK docks like Felixstowe.</p>

<h3>How It Messes with UK Gamers' Setups</h3>
<p>For UK players grinding Roblox or building epic PCs, this means real pain. Semiconductors power GPUs and CPUs in rigs like those RTX 4060 builds under £800 that crush 1440p Fortnite. With shipments halted, prices for new hardware could jump 15-25%, turning a £500 budget build into a £600 headache. European markets, including Game and Currys stores, face stock shortages—think delayed Xbox controllers or delayed Intel Panther Lake laptops for portable Minecraft sessions. Daily grinds get tougher: longer wait times for upgrades mean sticking with older gear, dropping frames in updates like Fortnite's Simpsons crossover. UK firms reliant on Asian manufacturing, per recent India-US pacts, feel the squeeze too, as Red Sea woes ripple to stable supply chains for gaming tech.</p>

<h3>What's Next: Eyes on Escalation</h3>
<p>Watch for US and UK naval responses boosting patrols, but Houthi threats persist. If strikes continue, expect broader trade alarms—higher costs for all imports, from snacks to SSDs. Gamers, stock up now; this Red Sea rift could glitch holiday hauls and push prices sky-high. Stay tuned to global headlines for reroute updates that might save your next-gen setup.</p></div>

 <h1>Sudan Army Airstrikes Hit Civilian Camps in Darfur Escalation</h1>
 <p><em>From the Global Conflicts and Disasters section – Straight facts, no filter.</em></p>
 <div class="story"><p>Imagine your favorite strategy game where one side bombs safe zones, wiping out player camps and forcing everyone to respawn elsewhere. That's the grim reality hitting Sudan right now, as the army's airstrikes slam into civilian camps in Darfur, killing at least 20 people and sending thousands fleeing. This fresh escalation, just days after rival forces seized a key city, has the UN screaming for a ceasefire to stop a full-blown famine from kicking in.</p>

<h3>RSF Grabs El-Fasher, Sparks Army Backlash</h3>
<p>Following reports from late October, the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) paramilitaries now hold full control of el-Fasher, the last major city in North Darfur not under their grip. This takeover came after brutal street fights that displaced hundreds of thousands. Now, the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) are hitting back hard with airstrikes on displacement camps around the area. Witnesses describe bombs dropping on tents packed with families who'd already run from earlier violence. "Reports of civilian killings are deeply alarming," officials said, as the SAF targets what they call RSF hideouts mixed in with the camps.</p>

<h3>UN Sounds Alarm on Escalating Carnage</h3>
<p>UN chief Antonio Guterres slammed the chaos as a "terrible escalation" of Sudan's civil war, now dragging into its third year. Experts warn of widespread atrocities against civilians in Darfur, echoing the genocide scars from two decades ago. Over the past 24 hours, aid groups report fresh strikes on November 2 that torched shelters and cut off food supplies. With 9 million already in catastrophic hunger—up from 8.5 million just days ago—these attacks risk tipping millions more into starvation. Guterres called for immediate de-escalation, saying, "The humanitarian catastrophe must end."</p>

<h3>International Crisis Group Flags African Hotspots</h3>
<p>The International Crisis Group's Autumn Watch List just dropped alerts on Sudan's spiraling conflicts, spotlighting Darfur as a powder keg among African trouble spots. Their update warns that the el-Fasher fall could unleash ethnic massacres, with both SAF and RSF forces accused of war crimes. In the last day, diplomats pushed for UN Security Council action, but rivalries stall progress. For UK gamers glued to global feeds, this hits home: Sudan's war disrupts supply chains for tech parts, potentially hiking prices on your next console or PC build amid everyday grinds like school and online matches.</p>

<h3>Famine Looms as Aid Trucks Get Hijacked</h3>
<p>Prior reports showed aid convoys looted, pushing hunger numbers sky-high. Now, with camps bombed, thousands more are on the move, clogging roads and worsening the crisis. The UN's famine declaration hangs by a thread—without a ceasefire, it could hit any day, affecting 25 million in total peril. Kids in Sudan, like you grinding levels in Fortnite, face real-world survival mode: no food, no safe spawn points.</p>

<p>Watch for UN votes this week; a ceasefire could pause the bombs, but history says Sudan's fights drag on. Stay tuned—global moves like these shape the world you log into daily, from news alerts to wallet hits on gear.</p></div>

    <h1>AWS Outage Hits Roblox and Fortnite Hard</h1>
    <p><em>From the Gaming Service Outages and Updates section – Straight facts, no filter.</em></p>
    <div class="story"><p>Imagine logging into Roblox for a quick build session after school, only to hit a wall of error messages. That's what hit gamers worldwide yesterday when Amazon's AWS cloud service crashed hard, knocking out Roblox, Fortnite, and even PlayStation Network (PSN). Thousands of apps and sites went dark, from social media to banking, leaving squads grounded and daily grinds on pause. But here's the good news: recovery is kicking in, with AWS back to normal operations as of early today.</p>

<h3>What Went Down with AWS</h3>
<p>AWS, the backbone for loads of online services, suffered a massive outage starting late on October 21, 2025. Connectivity issues spread globally, hitting over 1,000 companies and racking up 6.5 million disruption reports. Tech giant Amazon confirmed the chaos, with systems flickering offline for hours. In the UK, it even touched everyday stuff like Lloyds Bank logins, showing how one cloud glitch ripples into real life. For gamers, this meant no server access, no matches, just frustration during peak evening hours.</p>

<h3>Roblox and Fortnite Take the Hit</h3>
<p>Roblox users reported widespread downtime, unable to join games or chat with friends—perfect timing for after-school play. Fortnite fared no better, with Epic Games' battle royale mode stalling mid-drop, leaving players in limbo. The outage peaked around evening UK time, clashing with dinner-and-game routines. Amazon noted the issues stemmed from networking problems in their US-East region, but the knock-on effects were felt everywhere, grounding virtual adventures worldwide.</p>

<h3>PSN Joins the Blackout</h3>
<p>PlayStation Network (PSN) went dark too, blocking downloads, online multiplayer, and trophy syncs for Sony users. In the UK, where PS5 is huge among kids your age, this meant no FIFA kicks or Call of Duty raids after homework. The disruption hit thousands of gaming services, as AWS powers much of the backend for these platforms. Reports flooded in from Europe to the US, with some UK players venting on social media about lost progress in ongoing sessions.</p>

<h3>Recovery Rolls In</h3>
<p>By early October 22, Amazon declared AWS returning to "normal operations," with most services stabilizing. Snapchat, Reddit, and the big gaming names like Roblox and Fortnite started coming back online, though some hiccups lingered into the morning. CNN reported persistent issues in spots, but the bulk of the storm passed. For UK gamers, this meant grabbing controllers again by breakfast, but the scare highlighted how reliant we are on cloud tech—one AWS wobble, and your whole squad's plans crash.</p>

<p>Watch for any final tweaks from AWS updates; full stability should lock in soon. This outage? A raw reminder: in gaming's connected world, one glitch can ground everyone, but the grind bounces back quick. Stay logged in and squad up safely.</p></div>
